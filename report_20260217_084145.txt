ARCHIMATE:APPLICATIONCOMPONENT (129 components):
---------------------------------------------
  • P2 (Project Control Framework System): The rigid workflow engine that enforces PCF stages. It acts as a constraint on agility. Project Managers spend more time feeding P2 to get 'Green' operational metrics than managing actual site risks. It creates a 'watermelon' status reporting culture (green on the outside, red on the inside).
  • dIMS (Digital Integrated Management System): The central repository for asset inventory and condition data. The Route Strategy teams rely on this to justify maintenance spend. However, data gaps in drainage and geotechnical assets (earthworks) mean that the 'Condition' scores in the strategies often rely on Pavements (HAPMS legacy) as a proxy for overall asset health, distorting the risk profile.
  • National Traffic Information Service (NTIS): The central nervous system of the SRN. Processes data from MIDAS and floating vehicle data to feed the outcome: Journey Time Reliability. A legacy monolith currently undergoing painful transformation (NTIS V3), creating data latency issues for RCCs.
The 'Brain' of the network.
Aggregates data from MIDAS, ANPR, and floating vehicle data to generate the 'Traffic Common Picture'.

Feeds the NTC (National Traffic Centre) and third parties (Google, Waze).
Relies heavily on legacy inductive loop data (MIDAS), which is becoming unreliable.
Transitioning to floating vehicle data (FVD) is strategically planned but contractually complex due to data ownership issues.
The public-facing data engine (serves Google Maps, Waze, Logistics).
It sits outside the secure OT air-gap.
The friction point is the 'Air Gap' interface between HART (Control) and NTIS (Publishing).
Data diodes here frequently throttle real-time updates, meaning the public sometimes knows about a crash on Waze before the RCC Godstone operator sees it on HART.
The central nervous system for data aggregation located at Quinton NTOC.
Ingests raw telemetry from MIDAS loops, radar, and floating vehicle data.
Processes this into the 'Current Traffic Model'.
Critical tension: The latency in NTIS processing (batching cycles) often means third-party aggregators (Google) detect congestion faster than our own control room systems, creating a 'truth gap' for Traffic Officers.
The 'single source of truth' for public traffic data.
Updates regarding tunnel closures often lag behind real-time SCADA status by 2-5 minutes due to the interface friction between OT systems and IT corporate cloud environments.
The central nervous system for SRN data.
It feeds the roadside VMS (Variable Message Signs) and third-party nav apps.
The architectural bottleneck: NTIS is a legacy beast.
Real-time CAV data (millisecond latency) cannot flow through the current NTIS architecture effectively, creating a gap between 'what the car sees' and 'what the network knows'.
The public-facing data engine feeding sat-navs and overhead gantries.
Critical dependency: If Asset Management fails to update a 'Road Layout' change in the geography database, NTIS publishes wrong data, creating safety risks for drivers.

The aging operational brain.
It aggregates data from MIDAS and Floating Vehicle Data (FVD).
It is a legacy monolith that frustrates digital transformation because its data schema is rigid, making it difficult to integrate modern V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) data streams without expensive change requests.
The 'Brain' of the network (currently transitioning to cloud).
Ingests data from MIDAS and Floating Vehicle Data (FVD).
Trade-off: While it feeds public sat-navs effectively, internal latency issues occasionally cause disconnects with RCC operational views, leading to 'ghost' signs where signals are set but traffic has cleared.
The public-facing data engine feeding SatNavs and the Traffic England website.
Architectural vulnerability: It relies on a distinct data model from the operational HART system, leading to discrepancies where the public sees 'Road Closed' on Google Maps while the RCC sees 'Lane 1 Closed', causing driver confusion and reputational damage.
The central data hub that feeds the Traffic England map and sat-nav providers.
It aggregates data from MIDAS loops and Floating Vehicle Data.
However, latency issues mean the 'real-time' view is often 2-3 minutes behind reality, a critical gap when managing secondary incident protection on high-speed smart motorways.
The central nervous system for the SRN, aggregating data from MIDAS and floating vehicle data to feed the variable message signs (VMS).
It is a legacy monolith that is difficult to update.
A failure here blinds the NTOC and forces a fallback to manual radio checks.
The central national hub that aggregates data *from* local HART instances.
HART pushes incident and signal status data up to NTIS, which then disseminates it to the public (SatNavs, media).
A frequent architectural confusion is assuming NTIS controls signals; it does not.
HART controls the road; NTIS tells the world about it.
If the link between HART and NTIS fails (as seen in recent outages), the road is managed blindly regarding network-wide strategic diversion.
The central 'brain' of the SRN.
Ingests MIDAS, Floating Vehicle Data (FVD), and signals status.
It is the single source of truth for the Common Operational Picture, yet often suffers latency when feeding third-party apps versus internal control room displays.

The current 'brain' of the network.
Aggregates data from MIDAS and floating vehicle data.
A major architectural bottleneck; monolithic architecture makes integrating modern V2X data streams difficult.
Critical dependency for National Highways website and third-party sat-nav feeds.
The bridge that pushes tunnel status (Open/Closed/Speed Restriction) to the national network.
There is a persistent data quality issue where 'Tunnel Closure' events in SCADA don't always map correctly to 'Link Status: Closed' in NTIS, causing delays in updating SatNav providers and the Traffic England website.
The central 'brain' of the SRN, currently transitioning between service providers.
It ingests real-time data from MIDAS loops, floating vehicle data, and CCTV to generate the traffic picture for NTOC and RCCs.
The friction lies in modernising NTIS to accept high-frequency HART data streams without destabilising the legacy Datex II feeds that third-party aggregators rely on.

The central nervous system for traffic data.
It aggregates data from MIDAS, Floating Vehicle Data (FVD), and ANPR.
It feeds the roadside VMS (Variable Message Signs).
Critical trade-off: The system is monolithic and transition to the new 'Network operational data' contract is fraught with integration risks, threatening the accuracy of journey time reliability metrics.
The 'God Platform' of the SRN.
Aggregates data from MIDAS, HALOGEN, and Floating Vehicle Data (FVD).

NH benchmarks this against the Dutch specific traffic centres, but NTIS is uniquely centralized, creating a single point of failure that international peers often avoid with distributed architectures.
The legacy monolith.
It processes data from MIDAS loops and ANPR.
Despite the 'Digital Roads' vision, this aging system still underpins 90% of real-time decision making.
Replacing this with the new HART architecture is the biggest technical debt challenge we face.
The 'burning platform' legacy monolith.
Processes data from MIDAS loops and ANPR to generate the Network Model.
Critical dependency: If NTIS goes down, the NTI (National Traffic Interface) feeds to Google/Waze and internal VMS setting capabilities fail.
Architecture is rigid, hindering the shift to real-time connected vehicle data.
The central data aggregator.
Currently blind to real-time status of sub-systems within non-NH tunnels (Mersey/Tyne), forcing manual updates.
Struggles to ingest high-frequency vibration/air quality data from modern sensors.
The central data aggregation engine (Network Occupancy Management System).
Currently acts as a bottleneck for CAV trials; NTIS was designed for 1-minute latency updates for variable message signs (VMS), not the millisecond-level updates required for Connected Corridor hazard warnings.
The critical data aggregator platform.
Ingests raw telemetry from MIDAS, ANPR, and floating vehicle data to calculate journey times and set VMS signs.
While robust, its architecture struggles with the granular, low-latency requirements of connected vehicle (V2X) pilots.

Legacy Gen 2 system acting as the single source of truth for traffic data.
Major resilience risk: it is a monolithic point of failure.
Migration to Gen 3 is ongoing but hampered by legacy data interfaces.
The legacy data hub (currently transitioning vendors) that feeds the 'Traffic England' map and third parties like Google/Waze.
It creates a 'single source of truth' that often lags behind reality by 2-5 minutes, creating a hazardous delta between what the NTOC sees and what the public sees on VMS signs.

CRITICAL LIMITATION: Latency in updating VMS signs during rapidly changing wind conditions (e.g., at Dartford Crossing) creates a 2-3 minute risk window.
The 'Public Face' engine pushing data to SatNavs and logistics firms.
It relies on clean data from HART.
When SVD generates false alarms, NTIS inadvertently pushes 'phantom congestion' data to Google/Waze, damaging NH's reputational trust metric (User Satisfaction).

  • Command & Control System (Legacy HART / New CHARM): The dispatching system of record. Currently in a painful transition from legacy HART (Highways Agency Road Traffic) to the generic CHARM platform. This migration has caused significant friction in RCCs due to UI complexity and loss of 'muscle memory' for veteran dispatchers during high-pressure incidents.
  • HART (Highways Agency Response Tool): The cloud-native incident management platform replacing legacy Command & Control logging. It integrates directly with Airwave radio data but currently suffers from integration lag with the older NTIS feed, sometimes causing a discrepancy between 'actual' clearance time and 'reported' clearance time on the NOMS dashboard.
The central Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) replacing legacy COBS (Command and Control) systems.
Used by Regional Control Centres (RCCs) to set signs, signals, and log incidents.
Critical dependency for executing 'Red X' compliance and managing National Highways' statutory duty under the Highways Act 1980.
The primary Command and Control system used by National Highways control rooms to log incidents, manage resource availability, and coordinate response.
It replaces legacy Command & Control systems and integrates with Airwave radio data.
The unified traffic management system (replacing legacy CHARM) used by operators in Regional Control Centres (RCCs) to set signs and manage incidents.
  • Command & Control System (Legacy/CHARM): The operational dispatch system. Currently in a high-risk transition from legacy unintegrated systems to the CHARM (Common Highways Agency Rijkswaterstaat Model) platform. This migration is years late and causes friction between Control Centre operators (using the new interface) and on-road TOs (using legacy Mobile Data Terminals), risking data disconnects during critical incidents.
  • HALOGEN (Command & Control): The legacy backbone of incident logging. It is a 'burning platform' that constrains our ability to integrate real-time connected vehicle data. It forces manual double-keying of data by operators under stress.
  • HART (Highways Agency Road Management System): The cloud-native replacement for the legacy COBS system. It aggregates data from MIDAS and SVD radar to present incidents to RCC operators. Critical dependency: Currently struggling with latency issues when integrating high-volume telemetry from the M1 and M6 ALR sections, impacting the 'Time to Detect' metric monitored by the ORR.
The central asset inventory database.
Contains data on pavement condition, structures, and geotechnics.
Data quality issues here directly impact the accuracy of the 'Bridge Condition Index' (BCI) reporting, leading to sub-optimal renewal allocation.
The CHARM-based replacement for legacy traffic management systems.
Currently being rolled out to ROCs (e.g., Godstone, South Mimms).
Operational tension exists where operators must toggle between legacy COBS and HART UIs during the transition period.
The emerging replacement for legacy COBS systems.
Designed to ingest wider data sets including Connected Vehicle data, but currently facing integration challenges with legacy proprietary protocols used in the MFM and A2/M2 roadside beacons.
The emerging strategic asset system intended to replace HAPMS and SMIS.
Operational tension exists as migration is partial; renewal schemes often have to duplicate data entry into both legacy systems and HART, impacting delivery velocity.
The modern replacement for parts of the legacy IAM IS (Integrated Asset Management) stack.
Aimed at providing a 'Digital Twin' of pavement and roadside assets.
Adoption is slow due to data quality issues migrating from legacy HAPMS databases.
The successor to the monolithic HAPMS.
It attempts to federate asset data.
Critical for CAVs: an autonomous vehicle needs to know the Skid Resistance (SCRIM) and ride quality (LARS) of the A66 *before* it enters.
Currently, this data is siloed and retroactive, not predictive.
The strategic data lake initiative intended to replace the legacy HAPMS.
It aims to unify asset data (pavement, structures, geotech).
Currently in a tension-filled implementation phase where legacy data quality issues are hindering the 'Digital Twin' vision.
  • HART (Highways Agency Road Traffic) System - Roadside Technology: Middleware abstraction layer intended to decouple central systems from roadside devices. Development creates friction with the NRTS (National Roads Telecommunications Services) contract holder (Telent) regarding who owns the API definitions and latency SLAs.
  • HASS (Highways Asset Spatial System): The definitive geospatial inventory for SRN assets. While theoretically the 'single source of truth', it suffers from data latency issues during the handover from Major Projects (like A14 Cambridge) to Operations. Critical dependency for generating accurate deterioration models.
The definitive record of what NH owns (geospatial inventory).
It is critical for the A66 and A428 schemes to handover accurate data.
However, there is a sync lag between HASS and the operational maintenance systems (Confirm/Ellipse), meaning RCCs sometimes don't know the precise configuration of a newly upgraded junction.
  • HAPMS (Highways Agency Pavement Management System): The legacy monolithic 'system of record' for pavement data. Despite the 'Digital Roads' vision, this 20+ year old Oracle-based system still drives the logic for billion-pound renewal decisions. It calculates the Condition PI. It is a major blocker for real-time digital twin aspirations due to rigid schema structures.

It is technically obsolete and hinders predictive maintenance modelling, creating a 'data debt' friction point for the M25 reconstruction team who rely on it for volumetric scoping.
Legacy system representing a major technical debt.
It holds the pavement data required to justify RIS3 renewal funds.
Migration to the new IAM-IS (Integrated Asset Management) is lagging, meaning RIS3 evidence is partly based on fragmented spreadsheets and HAPMS extracts.

The system of record for SRN pavement inventory and condition data.
It stores historical survey data, construction history, and supports the modelling of pavement deterioration.
  • GDMS (Geotechnical Data Management System): Stores data on earthworks, slopes, and embankments. Critical for managing landslide risks (e.g., A66). Historically siloed from HAPMS, meaning pavement renewals often happen without awareness that the embankment underneath is failing.
Specialised application for managing geotechnical assets (earthworks, slopes, retaining walls).
It supports compliance with DMRB standard CS 641, tracking slope stability risks and informing geotechnical maintenance allocations.
The repository for geotechnical asset data, managing earthworks, slopes, and retaining walls.
Supports compliance with DMRB standard CD 622.
Critical for managing risks related to landslides and severe weather resilience.
The specialised application for managing geotechnical asset data (earthworks, slopes, embankments), supporting CS 641 (Managing the maintenance of highway geotechnical assets).
  • dTIMS Pavement Modelling Engine: The deterministic deterioration modelling engine used to predict pavement lifecycles across the SRN. It consumes SCANNER and TRACS data to output 20-year condition profiles. Operational reality: The model's calibration often diverges from regional engineering assessments (e.g., in Area 9), leading to 'computer says replace' vs. 'engineer says patch' conflicts. It struggles to accurately model the rapid failure curves of older Thin Surface Course Systems (TSCS) compared to Hot Rolled Asphalt.
  • HART (Highways Asset Resilience and Telemetry): The target state cloud-native platform replacing parts of NTIS. Currently in partial delivery for RIS3, focusing on uncoupling hardware operational status from traffic flow logic. It introduces an Event-Driven Architecture to ingest high-frequency sensor data from tunnels (e.g., A3 Hindhead) and smart motorways. Operational friction exists where HART data models clash with legacy DATEX II export structures required by third-party aggregators.
The target state Operational Technology platform intended to replace the fragmented COBS and HALOGEN landscape.
Currently in transitional deployment.
It aims to unify asset condition data (from inspections) with real-time operational status, but data migration from legacy YAML files is proving technically debt-heavy.
  • SMIS (Structures Management Information System): The master repository for the SRN's 20,000+ structures (bridges, gantries, retaining walls). Calculates the Bridge Condition Index (BCI) based on General and Principal Inspections (GI/PI) mandated by DMRB CS 450. Critical tension: It is a legacy relational database that creates a silo between pavement and structures planning, complicating the alignment of closures for cross-asset renewals (e.g., waterproofing a bridge deck while resurfacing the M6 J13-15).
The definitive register for 20,000+ bridges and structures.
Unlike pavement data, structures data relies heavily on manual General Inspections (GI) and Principal Inspections (PI).
Data latency can be up to 2 years between inspection and system entry, risking 'surprise' failures like the A52 Clifton Bridge closure.
The definitive database for bridge and structure assets on the SRN.

The definitive database for the inventory and condition of bridges, tunnels, retaining walls, and gantries on the SRN.
  • HADDMS (Highways Agency Drainage Data Management System): The definitive, yet perpetually struggling, repository for drainage asset inventory and condition data. It anchors the transition from cyclical to risk-based maintenance but suffers from historical data gaps (Legacy 'Grade 4' data). Crucial for generating the Mandated Drainage Maintenance schedules for M&R contractors.
The definitive asset register for drainage and outfalls.
Critical for managing run-off pollution into watercourses (DMRB LA 113).
Currently suffers from data quality issues where historical 'orphan' assets from the A-road network are unmapped, creating liability risks under the Water Framework Directive.
The legacy system of record for drainage assets.
Contains significant data quality gaps regarding asset condition and connectivity, specifically for culverts under the A1 and M1.
This lack of accurate data prevents precise hydraulic modeling for extreme precipitation events, forcing reliance on anecdotal 'flooding hotspot' lists.
  • PINS Infrastructure Planning Portal: External system hosting the Examination Library. NH teams must scrape/monitor this daily during Examination for 'Rule 6' letters and Interested Party representations. Lack of API integration creates manual overhead.
  • National Traffic Information Service (NTIS) Legacy Platform: The current 'burning platform'. Provides the traffic data feed to sat-navs and variable message signs (VMS). It is commercially constrained by legacy contracts, limiting our ability to innovate with real-time connected vehicle data. It feeds the NTIM (National Traffic Information Model).
The backbone of the SRN's situational awareness, feeding the Traffic England website and sat-nav providers.
It represents a significant 'Assurance Gap'.
While Major Projects are heavily audited, this aging logic-monolith (processing MIDAS loop data) receives insufficient technical debt assurance despite being critical for the 97% network availability KPI.
The aging heartbeat of the SRN.
Collects real-time traffic data from MIDAS loops and ANPR.
Currently a massive constraint on digital transformation due to proprietary interfaces (DATEX II v2.3) and high technical debt.
While the HART programme aims to replace it, NTIS still drives the control room walls at NTOC and RCCs.
If this fails, we lose visibility of the network.
The aging 'brain' of the network.
Aggregates data from MIDAS and ANPR.
Heavily constrained by 15-year-old architectural decisions.
Cannot ingest real-time connected vehicle data at scale without crashing the Datex II operational feed to broadcasters.
The primary bottleneck for Digital Roads vision.
The monolithic 'Network Model' engine located primarily at Quinton (with DR at Godstone).
It aggregates telemetry from 14,000+ MIDAS loops, ANPR cameras, and increasingly Floating Vehicle Data (FVD).
It is the 'single source of truth' for the SRN status, but suffers from significant technical debt.
It feeds the Traffic England website and the NVRM (National Variable Response Manager) for setting VMS signals.
Critically, it is the operational bottleneck for 'Digital Roads' transformation due to its tightly coupled architecture which complicates the migration to cloud-native microservices.
  • Citizen Space / Consultation Hub: The digital platform used to host consultation materials and ingest responses. A friction point exists here: the system structure often forces 'structured' data (radio buttons) while stakeholders want to submit unstructured 'free text' objections. Integration with backend analysis tools (Analyze, Nvivo) is often manual and error-prone.
  • HART (Highway Applications and Remote Traffic): The strategic replacement for legacy traffic management systems. Currently in a complex transitional phase. This represents the shift from 'monitoring traffic' to 'active traffic management' and digital twins, but integration with legacy MIDAS loops is proving technically debt-heavy.
The new cloud-native operational platform replacing legacy command and control systems.
It acts as the central nervous system for Traffic Officers and Control Room Operators.
Operational reality: Currently running in parallel with legacy stacks creating data synchronization friction.
Critical for enabling future Digital Roads initiatives but constrained by dependence on legacy roadside operational technology.
The new cloud-native data platform replacing legacy warehousing.
Critical for CAVs because legacy NTIS (National Traffic Information Service) has too high latency (minutes) for safety-critical V2X messaging (milliseconds).
HART is the architectural bridge to expose BCI (Bridge Condition Index) and TRads data to insurers.
The emerging cloud-native data platform intended to replace legacy reporting.
Currently runs in parallel, often showing different performance figures than NTIS, causing confusion during Monthly Performance Reviews.
The modern replacement/overlay for legacy reporting tools.
Provides real-time visibility of network performance, but adoption is uneven across regions accustomed to legacy spreadsheets and local knowledge.
  • IAM IS (Integrated Asset Management Information System): The system of record for pavement and structures. It holds the 'static' twin data (inventory). It is historically disconnected from operations, meaning Control Centres often lack real-time visibility of asset condition (e.g., barrier damage) until inspected.
The target repository for ADMM data, replacing legacy silos (HAPMS, SMIS).
Implementation complexity is high; data schemas from new construction (IFC/BIM) often fail to map cleanly to IAM IS maintenance schemas, requiring manual 'data cleaning' by SES or Digital Services.
The repository for asset inventory (Horizon/Echo).
Data quality is a major issue; 'as-built' data from Major Projects frequently fails to migrate correctly into IAM IS, leaving Operations with 'ghost assets' they don't know they need to maintain.
The central register replacing legacy SMIS (Structures Management Information System).
It holds the inventory of 30,000+ structures.
Tensions exist regarding data migration quality from SMIS, specifically regarding historic 'as-built' drawings for 1970s stock, which complicates load capacity assessments for heavy haulage.
The central repository for asset data.
Often receives poor quality 'as-built' data from Major Projects post-VE, leaving Operations unaware of the specific maintenance intervals required for cheaper, non-standard components.
The successor to HAPMS.
It is supposed to be the single source of truth for asset data.
However, data quality from legacy schemes is poor, meaning we often don't know the exact condition of drainage assets until they fail.
The repository for asset data.
Tier 1 contractors (Skanska/Balfour) struggle to upload valid BIM data here, leading to 'Data Gaps' where Operations doesn't know what equipment has been installed on new schemes.
The primary destination system for asset data.
It is a configured COTS product (largely Oracle-based) that struggles to ingest modern hierarchical BIM data.
It flattens complex 3D relationships into linear referencing (L1/L2), destroying the spatial context created during the design phase.
The 'Source of Truth' for asset inventory and condition.
In reality, data latency (from SCANNER surveys to system entry) means the 'digital twin' is often 6 months older than the physical road, leading to funding allocation for roads that have already deteriorated further.
The master asset register.
Rigid data schema often rejects bulk uploads from new schemes due to minor ADMM formatting errors, leaving assets unmaintained in the system despite being physically open to traffic.
Ideally the 'single source of truth', but often polluted by poor quality COBie drops from Major Projects, forcing manual data cleansing by the Digital directorate.
The intended 'Single Source of Truth' for asset inventory.
In reality, data quality is poor because maintenance contractors (AD contractors) maintain their own shadow databases.
The architectural gap between IAM IS and the actual state of the road results in abortive work visits.
The current strategic platform intended to replace HAPMS and consolidate asset data.
Implementation has been slower than projected in the RIS2 delivery plan.
Currently suffers from synchronization lag with legacy systems, creating 'two versions of the truth' for asset planners in the regions.
The intended 'Single Source of Truth' replacing HAPMS.
In reality, it's a complex federation of databases including ADMM (Asset Data Management Manual) schemas.
Data quality from supply chain 'As-Built' drawings is often poor, leading to a gap between the 'Digital Twin' and what's actually on the road.
The enterprise repository for asset inventory and condition data, superseding legacy HAPMS and SMIS systems.

The primary repository for National Highways asset data, progressively replacing legacy systems like HAPMS to provide a single source of truth for asset inventory and condition.
The core asset management system for National Highways (replacing legacy HAPMS functionality).
During the 'Enhance Network' stream, this system receives validated asset data (ADMM compliant) regarding new pavement, structures, and geotechnics to enable future maintenance planning.
  • PRISM (Project Reporting & Intelligence System): The system of record for Major Projects delivery. While JAGGAER handles the tender, PRISM holds the approved budget (Final Business Case). The lack of API integration between JAGGAER and PRISM during the evaluation phase creates a risk of awarding contracts that exceed the specific RIS3 allocated budget cap.
National Highways' central system for reporting project performance, financials, and risk data against the RIS baseline.
  • Network Occupancy Management System (NOMS): The operational chokepoint. Suppliers must book road space here. It feeds into the Network management dashboard. If a supplier booking in NOMS clashes with a diversion route, the system flags it, but often too late, requiring manual intervention by NROC.
The primary road space booking system used by supply chain and internal operational teams to schedule access (TSRGD-compliant traffic management).
It acts as the 'planned' truth for LARS.
Architectural weakness: The system incentivises 'ghost bookings'—contractors booking excess capacity 'just in case'—which artificially depresses predicted availability figures unless manually purged.
  • HART (Highways Analyst and Reporting Tool): Used by NH Intelligence Units to verify supplier claims about journey time reliability during roadworks. If a supplier says 'no delays caused' but HART shows a 15-minute spike, the CPF score is manually adjusted downwards.
The primary reporting engine for operational performance.
It aggregates data to calculate KPIs like Network Availability and Incident Clearance time.
It reveals the uncomfortable truth about 'Unknown' delay causes which frustrates ORR auditors.
The emerging single source of truth for traffic data.
Replaces legacy HATRIS.
Critical for calculating scope 3 emissions (road user tailpipe) by ingesting MIDAS and floating vehicle data to model network carbon footprints.
The modern visualization platform replacing legacy Oracle reports.
It integrates MIDAS flow data and collision stats.
Architects are currently struggling to integrate unstructured text data from Traffic Officer reports into HART to predict incidents before they become STATS19 statistics.

Essential for future digital roads capability but currently facing adoption resistance from veteran operators used to legacy consoles.
The future operational traffic management system replacing legacy stacks.
Major Projects are designing for HART integration, but HART itself is still evolving.
This creates an architectural 'moving target' risk for schemes like the A428, where the control room interfaces being built today may not match the system live date.
The target state enterprise data platform intended to replace legacy silos like HAPMS.
Currently in partial deployment, it provides the 'single source of truth' for asset condition (LARS) and pavement ages.
Operational reality: Regional architects still maintain shadow spreadsheets because HART ingestion pipelines for non-standard assets (e.g., older drainage types) are not fully mature.
The geospatial asset database used to model the 'Digital Twin' of the network.
Essential for providing the static map layers for AMoD.
The architectural gap is the 'update cycle'—HART data is often weeks behind physical reality (e.g., after emergency roadworks), posing a safety risk to autonomous systems relying on it for operational design domain (ODD) verification.
The primary repository for asset condition data (pavement, geotech, drainage).
Critical for calculating 'Likelihood' in risk assessments.
Legacy issues and data gaps in HART often force engineers to rely on anecdotal evidence rather than empirical data when prioritizing renewal works.
  • Collaborative Performance Framework (CPF): Internal NH system where supplier performance scores are recorded. Social Value scores from SVP are manually keyed into CPF, introducing human error risk and lagging indicators that don't reflect real-time site reality.
The digital toolkit used to record and visualise supplier performance scores across the Strategic Road Network (SRN) supply chain.
It aggregates data to support the Supplier Incentive Mechanisms (SIM) and strategic dialogue with Tier 1 partners.
  • BRAVO Solutions (Jaggaer) / Atamis: The legacy e-sourcing and contract management platform. It creates a data silo where contract variations are stored but not easily integrated with the Project Control Framework (PCF) or financial systems (Oracle), leading to visibility gaps on committed spend.
  • CEMAR (Contract Management System): The SaaS platform holding the 'single source of truth' for NEC4 contract administration (Early Warnings, Compensation Events). While it manages the workflow, it fails to integrate seamlessly with the Oracle financial ledger, necessitating manual 'swivel chair' data entry for actual payments, increasing error risk.
The SaaS platform (ThinkProject) where the 'war' happens.
All Early Warning Notices (EWN), Compensation Events (CE), and Project Manager Instructions (PMI) are logged here.
It is the single source of truth for commercial liability, distinct from the engineering reality in the Common Data Environment (CDE).
  • HART (Highways Asset Risk Tool): The target system for residual risk data from the H&S File. Used by Operations to plan maintenance. If CDM data isn't structured to map to HART taxonomies, manual workarounds are required, increasing the risk of unawareness during emergency repairs.
  • AIRSWeb Safety Management System: The primary platform for recording accidents and 'near misses'. While it captures acute injuries well, it struggles to effectively track chronic occupational health latencies like noise-induced hearing loss.
  • Esri ArcGIS Enterprise: The corporate GIS platform. Provides the geospatial view of the SRN. Integration with the asset database (IAM IS) is the biggest architectural headache we have right now.
  • HART (Highways Agency Road Network Topology): The master linear referencing system. It defines where 'M6 J19' actually is. If HART data is stale, the Control Centres (RCCs) send Traffic Officers to the wrong location.
  • Social Value Portal (SVP): Third-party SaaS platform used to track TOMs. It is NOT integrated with the National Highways Common Data Environment (CDE) or HART, creating a data silo where social value data exists separately from operational project controls.
  • HART (Highway Awareness, Restoration and Traffic): The target state data platform intended to replace legacy traffic systems. Currently in a complex transitional phase where it must ingest data from legacy loops while trying to integrate Connected Vehicle data. The coupling between HART and the actual roadside operational technology is currently fragile.
  • EnvIS (Environmental Information System): The central repository for environmental data (noise barriers, cultural heritage, landscape). Technically the 'single source of truth', but in reality, data from major schemes (A428, A66) is often bulk-uploaded late in the delivery phase (Stage 6), meaning Operations has zero visibility of new environmental assets until handover.
The central repository for environmental asset data.
In reality, it is a data graveyard.
Consultants dump GIS shapefiles here post-construction, but Operations rarely access it to maintain the assets (e.g., oil separators) effectively, leading to compliance drift.
Legacy system of record for National Highways environmental data.
Currently constitutes a significant technical debt; it struggles to ingest complex Defra Metric 4.0 spatial data structures, creating a 'digital gap' where BNG calculations live in disconnected Excel sheets rather than the enterprise architecture.
The specific National Highways system of record for environmental assets and data.
Stores inventory of noise barriers, cultural heritage sites, and landscape elements.
Essential for generating environmental asset management plans (EAMPs) and reporting against RIS performance metrics.
  • Oracle HCM Cloud: Human Capital Management. Critical for tracking Traffic Officer (TO) certifications and safety passports. If this drifts from reality, we risk deploying uncertified staff to live lanes.
The primary System of Record for employee data.
While functionally rich, its rigid workflows often clash with the dynamic nature of regional operations and incident response rostering, leading to 'shadow HR' spreadsheets in regional depots.
  • Bentley ProjectWise: The 'Source of Truth' for engineering data (ECM). It holds the DCO application documents for Lower Thames Crossing and A303 Stonehenge. If the CAD file isn't here, the bridge doesn't exist legally.
  • Microsoft Power BI Corporate Reporting: The visualization layer that aggregates LARS (Lane Availability) and KPI metrics for the DfT. It often masks the data quality issues lurking in the underlying source systems.
  • National Traffic Information Service (NTIS) Network Model: The central operational brain. It ingests data from MIDAS loops and Floating Vehicle Data (FVD) to calculate journey times. It is currently a legacy constraint; while it feeds sat-navs and VMS, its update cycle is too slow for the immediate demands of Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) trials defined in RIS3.
  • COBS (Control Office Base System): The legacy signalling control system used in RCCs to set speeds and red X signals on Smart Motorways. It is a critical dependency that is difficult to patch without requiring network downtime. It interfaces directly with roadside outstations via aged copper and fibre lines.
The specialized application component responsible for the interface between the control centre and roadside technology.
It translates operator commands into specific protocols to control Variable Message Signs (VMS), Advanced Motorway Indicators (AMI), and collect data from MIDAS outstations.
  • CHARM / DYNAC Traffic Management System: The Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) used in Regional Control Centres. There is a critical architectural coupling here: HART must deliver telemetry to CHARM with sub-second latency to ensure that when a Traffic Officer sets a 'Red X', it actually appears on the gantry. Recent software integration issues between the HART IP stream and the DYNAC controllers have caused programme delays.
The central Advanced Traffic Management System (Advanced Traffic Management System).
It acts as the source of truth for setting VMS signs.
We are struggling to expose CHARM data via API to the C-ITS cloud fast enough to match the visual signs, creating a dangerous 'latency gap' where the dashboard disagrees with the gantry.
The Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) used by RCCs to control roadside technology.
It interfaces with roadside outstations to set VMS text, speed limits, and lane closures (Red X).
Replacing the legacy HART system as part of the operational technology roadmap.
The operational interface used by ROC operators to set signals and monitor events (transitioning from legacy systems to a unified Advanced Traffic Management System).
  • NH Azure Data Lake (Raw Ingestion Layer): The 'Swamp'. Ingests raw telemetry from HALOGEN (incident logs), CHARM (traffic management), and SCANNER (pavement condition). Contains vast amounts of unstructured CCTV metadata and uncleaned MIDAS loop data. Critical for data scientists but dangerous for business reporting due to lack of schema enforcement and data quality controls.
  • Enterprise Data Warehouse (Curated Layer): Structured SQL environment (Snowflake/Synapse) where raw lake data is modelled into 'Gold' standard datasets for RIS reporting. This is where the 'One Version of the Truth' fights happen—reconciling P50 Availability figures between Operations and Strategy directorates. Feeds the ORR performance monitor reports.
  • Asset Deterioration Modelling Engine (dTIMS/Python): Predictive analytics engine using machine learning to forecast pavement and structure degradation. It ingests HAPMS and IAM-IS data to generate the 'Forward Works Programme'. There is significant tension here: the model often suggests renewals that Regional Delivery Partnerships (RDPs) cannot deliver within the RIS2 funding envelope due to inflation.
  • PowerBI Corporate Performance Dashboard: The executive visualization layer used by the Board and DfT. Displays KPI metrics like 'Killed or Seriously Injured' (KSI) reductions and 'Customer Service Score'. Often masks the underlying data quality issues in the source systems (HALOGEN) regarding incident classification.
  • ESDAL (Electronic Service Delivery for Abnormal Loads): Legacy monolith used by hauliers to plot Abnormal Indivisible Load (AIL) routes. A major friction point: the interface is antiquated, causing high manual processing overhead for Structure owners to approve bridge crossings. Acts as a constraint on the 'Digital Roads' vision due to hard-coded logic regarding structural weight limits and lack of integration with the modern geospatial asset register (IAM).
A web-based portal allowing hauliers to plot routes and notify police and bridge authorities.
It integrates with National Highways structure data to automatically check route viability against bridge weight limits.
  • Street Manager (DfT Central Service): External SaaS platform mandated by DfT for lane rental and roadworks permitting. NH must integrate with this despite it being designed primarily for Local Authorities. Creates an architectural boundary issue where NH data (from Schedule of Roadworks) must flow into a system we do not control to coordinate with utility companies.
  • Local Tunnel SCADA (PLC Logic): The operational brain: Siemens or similar PLC logic handling real-time matrix, ventilation, and barrier interlocks. Operates independently of national systems (HART/NTIS) to ensure fail-safe operation. A major legacy constraint; upgrading this requires full tunnel closures, clashing with P50 availability targets.
  • Legacy Tunnel SCADA Systems: Fragmented operational technology estate. Many tunnel PLCs are effectively 'black boxes' that do not expose API data to the National Traffic Information Service (NTIS). Maintenance relies on specialist contractors rather than standard TS operational teams.
  • Tunnel Control System (SCADA) - Hindhead Local Node: Local operational technology (OT) controlling fans, lighting, and barriers. Represents a legacy 'island of automation' that does not fully integrate with the national HART (Highways Agency Road Traffic) system, causing data silos.
  • MIDAS (Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling): Queue protection system on tunnel approaches. Vital for preventing secondary collisions (which account for 20% of casualties) when the tunnel suddenly closes.
Legacy induction loop and radar system embedded in the carriageway.
Provides HIOCC (High Occupancy) alerts for queue protection.
Currently faces obsolescence challenges and maintenance access issues on busy ALR sections.
A distributed system of inductive loops and radar sensors that detects traffic flow and queueing.
It automatically triggers 'Queue Caution' signals and feeds data into control room systems for congestion analysis.
  • Legacy Tunnel SCADA System (Modbus/PLC): Disparate Operational Technology (OT) layer across older tunnels. Often runs on out-of-support Windows versions or aging PLC hardware. Creates a 'digital air gap' where real-time asset condition data (fan vibration, CO levels) cannot easily feed into national systems like HART or IPM (Integrated Planned Maintenance), preventing predictive maintenance.
  • A3 Hindhead Tunnel SCADA Master System: Primary Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition assembly (WinCC OA based) for the A3 Hindhead tunnels. Orchestrates sub-systems (ventilation, lighting, linear heat detection) and provides the HMI for RCC Godstone. High operational friction due to proprietary protocols preventing easy integration with the modern HART data lake initiatives. Criticality: P1.
  • Tunnel Video Management System (MIST Protocol): CCTV aggregation layer. Uses the legacy MIST protocol (unlike the ONVIF standards pushed by Digital D&D). This forces a complex translation layer to get video feeds into the National Traffic Operations Centre (NTOC) video wall, causing 3-5 seconds of latency which is borderline acceptable for incident management.
  • Tunnel SCADA & Ventilation Control System: Legacy Operational Technology (OT) controlling jet fans and extractors. In a HAZMAT incident, this system must switch ventilation strategies (longitudinal vs. transverse) instantly. Integration with the newer CHARM/HART platform remains a complex architectural debt item, creating a 'swivel-chair' interface for operators.
  • Tunnel Facility Management System (Legacy SCADA): On-premise control software. Lacks cybersecurity patching compliance for modern standards (TS 50701). Data silo that does not feed real-time asset condition to the National Traffic Information Service (NTIS), blinding the National Network Manager to granular tunnel availability risks.
  • CHARM / ATMS (Advanced Traffic Management System): The National Control Centre system that must ingest V2X data (stopped vehicle alerts, pothole detection). Currently struggling to integrate high-frequency probe data from connected vehicles without overwhelming the operator interface in the RCCs.

The outcome of the Charm programme (Collaborative Highways for Advanced Road Management), replacing legacy HART and instation systems.
It provides the unified interface for RCC operators to set signals, manage VMS, and log incidents.
  • HART (Highway Applications and Remote Tolling): Legacy command and control system used in RCCs. Monolithic architecture that is difficult to update. Impedes the integration of modern, API-driven data sources from Connected Vehicles.
  • HART (Highway Audit and Readiness Tool): The critical digital system mapping the SRN's 'readability' for AVs. Currently a strategic prototype, but the Law Commission's recall powers imply HART must become a safety-critical system (SCS) to warn ASDEs of infrastructure degradation (e.g., faded white lines).
  • CHARM (Common Highways Agency Rijkswaterstaat Model): The delayed 'savior' system intended to replace HART. Deployment has been fraught with integration complexities between standard IT protocols and non-standard roadside OT (legacy serial connections). The tension between 'configuration' (Standard) and 'customisation' (NH Specifics) has blown budgets and timelines.
The perpetually delayed next-gen traffic management system intended to replace HART.
Meant to harmonize operations between England and the Netherlands.
Its deployment delays enforce reliance on legacy technology, stalling the Modernising Operational Systems (MOS) programme.

The Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) used in RCCs to monitor the network, control electronic signals/signs, and manage incident workflows, replacing legacy operational systems.
  • ProjectWise / Asite (Federated CDE): The Common Data Environments (CDE) used by the supply chain (e.g., Skanska, Balfour Beatty) to host the Project Information Model (PIM). Critical architectural flaw: NH does not own the native CDE for every scheme; we often only receive the exports, losing the rich metadata context and audit trails contained in the contractor's proprietary environment.
  • Traffic England (Web & Public Service Wrapper): The public-facing digital front-end for SRN status. While visibly the primary channel for the public, it suffers from technical debt and architectural coupling to the legacy NTIS Model 1 architecture. It struggles to compete with the latency and UI/UX of Google/Waze but remains the 'single source of truth' for statutory closure data and confirmed incidents (verified by NTOC). Displays feed from MIDAS and CCTV, subject to filtering for privacy (GDPR) and suicide prevention protocols.
  • HART (Highways Agency Road Traffic) Platform: Cloud-native replacement initiative for legacy traffic data systems. Currently running in parallel with NTIS. The tension lies in the migration strategy: we are maintaining dual costs for cloud ingress/egress while legacy operational apps (COBS) refuse to decouple from the old NTIS operational database.
  • Tunnel Facility Management System (SCADA/PLC): The operational technology controlling ventilation, lighting, and drainage. In older assets, this is often running on legacy OS (Windows 7/XP) with air-gapped security. There is a critical dependency here: modernizing these systems for cyber-compliance often requires long-duration closures that destroy Network Availability metrics (P50), leading to deferral of upgrades.
  • CHARM (Collaborative Traffic Management System): The Advanced Traffic Management System deployed at Regional Control Centres (e.g., Godstone, Quinton). It replaces legacy COBS. Integration with the new SVD (Stopped Vehicle Detection) radar has been operationally painful, causing high false alarm rates that frustrate Traffic Officers and skew LARS (Lane Availability Reporting System) metrics.
  • Oracle Fusion HCM: The primary ERP system of record for workforce data. Currently acts as a constraint on agility due to poor integration with operational rostering systems used in RCCs, creating a 'data gap' between theoretical headcount and actual shift availability for incident response.
  • Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS): Our legacy ERP backbone. It is a significant constraint on digital transformation. While we have fancy front-end dashboards, the core ledgers are rigid. Integrating real-time asset costs from IAM IS (Asset Management) into Oracle for accurate Whole Life Costing is a manual, friction-heavy nightmare.
The monolithic legacy ERP.
Handles General Ledger and Accounts Payable.
It forces a 'capitalisation' logic that makes tracking operational expenditure (OpEx) on Smart Motorway technology refreshes painful.
The current, highly customised on-premise ERP handling general ledger, AP/AR, and procurement.
It is end-of-life and heavily modified to support the 'Scheme Accounting' logic used for the Roads Investment Strategy (RIS).
It currently creates a data silo that disconnects financial actuals from the project performance data in the miserable Excel spreadsheets used by Commercial Directors.
  • Claims Management & Recovery System: The legacy case management database used by the Green and Red claims teams. It lacks real-time integration with the Command and Control system (control works) or HART, requiring manual data scraping from incident logs to prove liability. This 'swivel-chair' integration is a major leakage point for cost recovery.
  • Salesforce CRM (Stakeholder Engagement): The central repository for tracking interactions with landowners, MPs, and local authorities. It is heavily customized and often poorly integrated with the Correspondence Tracking System (CTS), leading to data silos where regional project teams (e.g., A428 delivery) may not be aware of previous commitments made by the Public Affairs team to local MPs.
  • HART Legacy Command & Control System: Ageing operational technology used in Regional Control Centres. Represents a massive unmitigated technical debt risk. If HART fails, manual contingency (traffic officers on patrol) cannot maintain safe SRN operations, yet replacement is consistently deferred for 'value engineering'.
  • Building Management System (BMS): Centralized control of HVAC, lighting, and access control across the estate. Currently fragmented across regions; lack of a unified 'Digital Twin' for the estate prevents predictive maintenance, leading to reactive failures in control room cooling systems.
  • Total Resource Management (TRM) System: The rostering engine for Traffic Officers and RCC staff. It determines who is on the road. The legacy system has poor integration with the Oracle HR record, leading to payroll errors for shift allowances—a massive dissatisfier for frontline staff that the People Strategy must resolve to prevent union action.
  • AIRSWeb (Safety Reporting System): Legacy system of record for all incidents (accident, near miss, abuse). UX friction often leads to under-reporting of 'low level' hazards by supply chain, skewing the Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) data used for executive reporting.
  • Nochex / Network Occupancy Management System: The system used to book road space. The clash point: Maintenance contractors, Major Projects, and Utilities all fighting for the same stretch of the M1. Conflicts are often resolved by 'he who shouts loudest' rather than strategic optimization.
  • CHARM (Dynac) Advanced Traffic Management System: The primary operational interface replacing legacy COBS. Controls signals, variable speed limits, and receives MIDAS/SVD alerts. Deployment was delayed; currently creates friction where legacy COBS protocols clash with Dynac's object-oriented logic. Specific reliance for Smart Motorway signaling.
  • AIRS (Accident and Incident Reporting System): Legacy internal system for recording RIDDOR events, staff injuries, and asset damage. While it captures the 'what', it struggles to capture the unstructured 'why' or root cause analysis effectively for wider dissemination.
  • HART (Highways Action Response Tool): The replacement for the legacy HALOGEN/COBRAS stack. A cloud-native operational control system. Currently creating operational friction as veteran operators struggle with UI latency compared to the instant response of legacy command-line tools. Critical dependency for managing Smart Motorway signals and variable speed limits.
The primary operational logging and dispatch system replacing legacy Command & Control functionality, used to manage incidents and record timelines for performance reporting.
  • Dart Charge Payment System: The primary 'User Pays' revenue collection engine on the SRN. It is not just a billing system; it is a critical demand management tool for the Dartford Crossing. Failure here causes immediate tailbacks onto the M25 (Safety Critical). Recently transitioned vendors, highlighting the fragility of legacy tolling data migration.
  • Bravo (Jaggaer) eSourcing: The procurement front-end used by Commercial to tender packages. A legacy constraint; it creates a data silo where tender pricing data sits, often disconnected from the actual out-turn cost data in CEMAR, making 'Should Cost' modelling for future RIS periods difficult.
  • HART (Highways Agency Road Traffic) - Highways Asset Risk Tool (HART): The strategic asset management system replacing HAPMS; designed to predict failure (potholes, flooding) using decay modelling; adoption is hindered by poor quality historic data (LARS/SCANNER) migration.
  • WebDris / DAS (Departures Approval System): The repository of engineering concessions. It represents a massive, largely untapped dataset of where the DMRB is failing to meet modern delivery constraints or innovation needs.
The legacy operational system used to log, track, and approve departures from DMRB.
It is a critical data silo that contains the record of all accepted risks on the network, but is poorly integrated with the newer IPM (Integrated Project Management) platform and GDMS (Geotechnical Data Management System).
  • IAM (Integrated Asset Management) / HAPMS: The system of record for pavement and structures. Currently transitioning from HAPMS to the new IAM stack. Data quality is poor; regional teams often keep 'shadow spreadsheets' of asset condition because they don't trust the central LARS/SCANNER data ingest.
  • Asset Management System (IAM): The repository of truth for SRN assets. It is cluttered with poor quality historical data (legacy HAPMS imports). AI predictive maintenance initiatives fail here because the training data for pavement degradation is inconsistent across different Areas (e.g., Area 9 vs Area 10 data standards differ).
The master asset register (based on confirm/statutory data).
It contains significant data gaps ('unknown' condition scores) for legacy drainage and geotechnical assets, making risk-based funding allocation for RIS3 highly speculative.
  • HART (Highways Agency Road Traffic) Core System: The legacy operational Command & Control (C&C) system deployed locally across Regional Control Centres (RCCs) such as Godstone, South Mimms, and Wakefield. While ostensibly being superseded by the CHARM program, HART remains the 'fingers-on-glass' reality for Traffic Officers setting signals on the SRN. It creates the critical abstraction layer between the operator and the HALOGEN subsystem to drive AMI (Advanced Motorway Indicators) and MS4 signs. Critical tension: It is a legacy monolith that struggles to support modern RIS2 Connected Corridor initiatives without significant middleware wrappers.
The absolute bedrock legacy system for historical traffic data.
Despite being archaic, Route Strategies depend on HART data to prove congestion hotspots (Delay > 10s/vehicle/km).
The lack of granular integration with newer HATRIS analysis tools creates significant manual overhead during the evidence phase.
The legacy command and control system used in Regional Control Centres (RCCs).
It is ancient.
We are trying to migrate to CHARM (Advanced Traffic Management System), but the integration with legacy roadside technology (end-of-life transponders) is a nightmare.
This system creates the 'Setting of Signals' capability.
The operational booking system for road space.
Inspections cannot happen without a HART booking.
Friction occurs when maintenance bookings clash with Major Projects (e.g., A66 Northern Trans-Pennine upgrades) or events, leading to aborted inspections and wasted costs.

Monolithic architecture with significant technical debt.
While robust, it struggles to integrate with modern Connected Corridor data streams.
Its retirement is contingent on the stalled CHARM programme, creating a 'burning platform' risk for network availability.
Legacy traffic management system.
Approaching end-of-life but still critical for setting signs and signals in many regions.
The migration to CHARM has been fraught with delays, leaving us with a fragmented operational technology landscape.
It is end-of-life but remains the primary tool for setting signals because the replacement (CHARM) rollout has been repeatedly delayed by technical debt.
The cloud-native replacement strategy for legacy traffic systems.
Designed to ingest probe data (floating vehicle data) rather than just fixed infrastructure (loops).
Currently in coexistence phase with NTIS, creating data duplication and synchronization issues during the transition period.
The legacy operational technology (OT) monolith.
Written in the 1990s, it connects to roadside outstations.
It is the absolute constraint on digital transformation.
We cannot turn it off without blinding the network, yet it struggles to ingest modern data streams like Connected Vehicle data.
It represents the ultimate 'Technical Debt' risk on the SRN.
The legacy command and control monolith.
Despite digital transformation promises, this 20+ year old system still drives the logs.
It has hard dependencies on NTOC and fails to integrate seamlessly with modern asset management platforms, creating a 'swivel-chair' data gap for operators.
Legacy control system used in Regional Control Centres.
Struggles to integrate with modern roadside technology delivered by new schemes (e.g., specific radar types on A428), creating a 'swivel chair' integration requirement for operators.

Replacement by CHARM has been delayed, creating a dangerous hybrid operating model where operators swivel-chair between systems.
Legacy command and control system.
It is technically obsolete and officially 'end of life', yet remains the primary interface for setting signals and VMS signs across the North and Midlands.
The dependency on this legacy stack prevents the full realisation of Digital Roads outcomes.
Legacy operational command and control system used in RCCs.
A major architectural debt.
It constrains digital transformation because its monolithic structure makes integrating modern Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2X) data streams difficult.
The operational command system used in RCCs to set signals and signs.
It is aged technology (based on old HALOGEN logic).
Attempts to replace it with a modern CHARM solution have faced immense integration complexity.
If HART fails, the Smart Motorway network defaults to 'dark', losing all variable speed limits.
The operational traffic management system used in RCCs.
It allows operators to set signals and signs.
It is a critical legacy system with a clunky UI that increases cognitive load on operators during multi-incident scenarios on the M25.
The command and control system used by TOs and RCCs.
It is legacy, clunky, and text-heavy.
It is not intuitive for new recruits and struggles to integrate with modern data feeds from connected vehicles, creating a 'swivel chair' interface problem in the control room.
The unkillable legacy mainframe application that still underpins signal setting on the Strategic Road Network.
Despite the CHARM programme's intent to replace it, HART remains the fail-safe operational reality.
It constrains digital transformation because it cannot ingest modern V2X data streams or high-frequency sensor data without middleware wrappers.
End-of-life but still critical for signal setting in many regions.
Interacts poorly with newer radar-based Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD), creating false alarms that desensitize control room operators (Alert Fatigue).
The 20+ year old monolithic command and control system.
It controls the signals and signs on the motorway.
It is fragile, difficult to change, and a massive constraint on digital transformation.
If HART fails, the Smart Motorways essentially go blind.
The aging command and control system (20+ years old) that still underpins network operations.
It struggles to ingest high-frequency data from modern SVD radar, acting as a bottleneck for real-time digital twin aspirations.
The underlying historic data warehouse associated with network operations.
Often confused with NTIS by outsiders, HART effectively acts as the deep storage for historic traffic data used for modelling and post-incident analysis.
There is a data gravity issue here: modern Data Science teams want to extract this data for Azure-based analytics (powering Digital Twin initiatives), but the schema is antiquated and extraction impacts operational performance.
The aging master system for recording unplanned events.
Despite digital transformation initiatives like 'Digital Roads', HART remains the single source of truth for validated incident data.
It forces manual re-keying of data from the Command & Control system, introducing human error that directly skews LARS (Long-term Average Response Speed) calculations.
The strategic successor to legacy traffic management systems (CHARM).
Intended to unify command and control across all RCCs.
Real-world status: Deployment has been fragmented, creating a 'swivel chair' architecture where operators toggle between HART and legacy systems to set signals on older gantries.
Vital for enabling the Digital Roads vision but currently a source of operational latency.
The cloud-native successor to the legacy CHARM/COBS command and control systems.
Currently being rolled out to RCCs (e.g., RCC Godstone, RCC Wakefield).
Critical for handling Smart Motorway incidents, but facing integration latency issues with legacy roadside sensing equipment (MIDAS).

The modern cloud-native traffic management platform slowly replacing the legacy CHARM system.
Designed to ingest high-volume probe data from CAVs, but currently throttled by interface limitations with older regional control systems.
The emerging replacement for legacy traffic management.
Trade-off: introduces data synchronisation errors with legacy systems during the transition period (RIS2/RIS3 overlap).
Operational control system used by RCCs.
Requires precise location data for MIDAS loops, CCTV, and Signals.
If MP fails to provide accurate ADMM location data, Traffic Officers cannot set signals correctly for incidents, impacting KPI 'Incident Resolution Time'.

ARCHIMATE:APPLICATIONINTERFACE (1 components):
---------------------------------------------
  • DATEX II Open Data Publication API: The strategic pivot for NH digital strategy. Instead of building better apps, we expose SRN data via ISO 14827 (DATEX II) standards to third-party developers (SatNav providers, logistics firms). This creates a dependency where our operational reputation relies on how accurately third parties interpret our closure data. Critical for meeting DfT 'Open Data' mandates.

ARCHIMATE:APPLICATIONSERVICE (18 components):
-------------------------------------------
  • Virtual Consultation Platform (Citizen Space/Aecom): Digital engagement layer for DCO (Development Consent Order) applications. Critical for schemes like the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine and Lower Thames Crossing. Tensions arise here between 'digital inclusion' requirements and the massive complexity of engineering data presented to the public. Failure here leads to Judicial Review risks.

ARCHIMATE:ASSESSMENT (91 components):
-----------------------------------
  • Asset Condition Assessment (BCI & SCRIM): Data derived from Bridge Condition Index (BCI) and Sideway-force Coefficient Routine Investigation Machine (SCRIM). The deteriorating trend in these metrics indicates a 'maintenance backlog' that is often ignored in favor of shiny new capital projects like LTC, creating a 'time bomb' in the operational architecture.
Bridge Condition Index.
A critical and critical-weighted average score.
Many post-tensioned bridges from the 1970s are deteriorating.
The trade-off is between expensive propping/strengthening works and imposing weight restrictions which harm the economy.
  • Asset Condition: Pavement (LARS/SCANNER): Data derived from TRACS/SCANNER vehicles measuring rutting, texture, and profile. The tension: Data often shows degradation (Amber/Red) requiring intervention, but funding constraints force a 'managed decline' approach on Tier 2/3 roads.
Metrics derived from TRACS and SCANNER surveys.
Used to calculate the Pavement Condition Index (PCI).
A critical trade-off exists here: Strategy teams often prioritize 'visible' pavement defects to satisfy user metrics (Transport Focus), potentially neglecting 'invisible' but critical structural degradation (bridges/concrete cancer) which has higher catastrophic risk.
  • KPI: 60-Minute Incident Clearance: Operational target to clear 85% of incidents within an hour. Tension: Police forensic requirements (Collision Investigation) often override this target, yet the penalty sits with National Highways in the ORR assessment.
  • ORR Annual Assessment: The Office of Rail and Road's verdict on NH performance. The Board fears this document. It measures compliance against the Licence, focusing on KPIs like 'Pavement Condition' (LARS data) and 'Structure Condition' (BCI). A poor assessment triggers DfT intervention.
Formal regulatory evaluation.
Highlights: Missed KPI for 'Average Delay' (P50), Amber status on 'Pavement Condition', and scrutiny over the £1bn+ slippage in the enhancement portfolio due to DCO (Development Consent Order) legal challenges.
  • Road Investment Strategy (RIS) Efficiency KPI: The Treasury-mandated target to cut costs. Creates a perverse incentive to defer maintenance (lowering OPEX) and choose cheaper capital solutions that have higher whole-life costs, effectively mortgaging the future asset condition.
The formal contract with DfT.
Includes KPIs like 'P50 Network Availability' and 'Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI)' reduction.
Failure to meet these results in ORR enforcement action.
This drives the perverse incentive to prioritize interventions that boost the score over long-term asset health.
  • Pavement Condition Indicator (LARS/SCANNER): The definitive metric for road surface health derived from TRACS/SCANNER surveys. Currently flashing red for concrete sections on the A14 and M25. The data reveals a backlog of renewal needs that exceeds the allocated RIS3 operations budget, forcing a 'patch and mend' strategy.
The primary metric for road surface health; dictates renewals funding allocation; heavily criticized by regions for not reflecting the 'driver feel' of potholes, leading to a disconnect between central investment modelling and local repair needs.
  • Integrated Assurance Review (IAR) Report: The output of independent reviews (IPA or internal). Often contains 'Amber/Red' delivery confidence ratings that are politically sensitive. These reports highlight optimism bias in schedules and are frequently redacted in public FOI requests.
  • KPI - Network Availability (P50) & Incident Clearance Time: The primary ORR performance metric. Perverse Incentive: Encourages rapid reopening of lanes potentially compromising forensic data capture or thorough infrastructure safety checks (e.g., barrier integrity) after collisions.
The percentage of the network available to traffic.
Renewal works (paving) negatively impact this metric.
This creates a perverse incentive to delay necessary maintenance or push it into short overnight windows that increase cost and reduce quality.
The primary performance metric for RIS2/RIS3, measuring the percentage of the network available to traffic.
Calculation is heavily skewed by how 'roadworks' are logged in the Network Occupancy Management System (NOMS).
There is a perverse incentive to classify emergency repairs as 'planned works' where possible to protect the LARS (Lane Availability Reporting System) score.
This is the metric that operations managers live and die by.
It creates a perverse incentive: delay maintenance interventions (which require lane closures) to keep availability high today, at the cost of asset degradation that causes unplanned failures tomorrow.
The metric measuring how much of the SRN is open to traffic.
Calculated via complex logic over NTIS data, often disputed by regional operations managers.
The primary operational metric: the percentage of traffic flowing at least 50% of the speed limit.
This metric drives behaviour in RCCs to clear incidents quickly, sometimes creating tension with Traffic Officers who prioritize on-scene safety over flow restoration.
The primary metric for customer journey reliability.
Measures the percentage of the network available to traffic.
Construction works (like the A66 dualling) negatively impact this, creating a perverse incentive to delay necessary maintenance to keep the P50 score green for the ORR report.
It dictates operational behavior.
Regions will delay necessary technology upgrades (patching servers) to avoid 'unplanned unavailability' penalties.
This metric prioritizes 'road open' over 'system secure', creating a latent cybersecurity risk in the OT estate.
Percentage of traffic flow without delay.
Heavily penalised by roadworks.
Creates a perverse incentive to delay essential maintenance (Renewal Schemes) to protect the immediate P50 score.
The Planning Time Index metric.
A statistical abstraction derived from vehicle flow data that fails to account for the customer frustration of 'ghost jams' caused by MIDAS loop failures on the M6 and M1 corridors.
The primary operational metric: % of the network available to traffic.
Heavily penalized by Major Projects (A428, A66) and Asset Delivery (renewal works).
Regional Directors live or die by this number, leading to 'phantom' roadworks booking conflicts.
Key KPI: Percentage of traffic flowing at 50% or more of the speed limit.
Often manipulated by scheduling roadworks (LARS bookings) outside peak hours, masking the true degradation of journey time reliability caused by unplanned incidents and long-term TTM (Temporary Traffic Management) for major schemes.
Key performance metric: Percentage of traffic flowing freely.
Tunnel closures (preventative or reactive) decimate this metric for entire regions.
Creates perverse incentive to delay deep-maintenance interventions.
  • KIM (Key Incident Management) Performance Metric: The internal metric tracking the timeline of major incidents. It specifically penalizes the 'slide' between estimated reopening times given to the media (via NTOC) and the actual handover time, highlighting the disconnect between on-road reality and control room estimation.
  • KPI: P50 Network Availability (97.5% Target): The primary operational metric for RIS2/RIS3 performance. It measures the percentage of the network available to traffic. Debriefs often devolve into arguments about 'start time' vs 'end time' codes in C&C logs, as a shift of 5 minutes in a major closure affects the regional P50 score. INCENTIVE RISK: Managers are incentivized to code incidents as 'Debris' rather than 'Infrastructure Failure' to protect availability stats.
  • 10-Minute Response Metric (ALR): The critical post-Stocktake performance metric: TOs must reach a stopped vehicle in a live lane on Smart Motorways within 10 minutes. This metric drives the positioning of 'Strategic Standby Points'. It creates a perverse incentive to cluster patrols on ALR sections (M1, M6, M25) at the expense of conventional motorways, leaving A-roads (A14, A303) with slower response times.
  • KPI: Clearance of Incidents < 1 Hour: The primary efficiency metric from the ORR delivery plan. Failure here results in 'Lost Customer Hours' penalties. This drives the 'drag and drop' culture—moving damaged vehicles to the hard shoulder or ERA rather than full recovery on scene—which sometimes conflicts with police forensic requirements at serious collisions.
  • P50 Planning Time Index Metric: Key operational performance metric measuring journey time reliability. Operations directorates are incentivized to hit this, which creates tension when Major Projects require lane closures that degrade this score.
  • KSI (Killed or Seriously Injured) Statistics: The ultimate safety metric reported to the ORR (Office of Rail and Road). The stagnation of KSI reduction on A-roads is driving a shift in focus from motorways to single-carriageway safety interventions in RIS3.
The ultimate safety metric.
The tension exists here: The statistic is lagging (takes months to validate via CRASH/STATS19), making it difficult to use for real-time operational decision-making or immediate intervention on accident blackspots.
  • Network Availability KPI (RIS3): The primary performance metric (target >97% lane availability). Severe weather closures directly penalize this metric unless classified as 'Force Majeure', leading to administrative friction between Delivery Directorates and ORR regarding event classification.
A critical RIS2/RIS3 performance metric derived directly from NTIS calculations of lane availability vs.
closure.
This metric drives funding and penalties.
There is a perverse incentive here: NTIS logic defines how 'available' the road is, meaning architectural defects in NTIS (e.g., failing to register a closure correctly due to sensor drop-out) can artificially inflate operational performance scores reported to the ORR (Office of Rail and Road).
  • ORR Safety Compliance Report: Annual regulatory stick used by the Office of Rail and Road. Specifically targets the '10-minute response time' KPI for stranded vehicles in live lanes. This metric drives the aggressive dispatch of Traffic Officers, sometimes at the expense of their own safety protocols during high-speed rolling road blocks.
  • Pavement Residual Life Calculation: Algorithmic assessment determining the structural remaining life of the carriageway. Influences the 'Depreciation' financial metric reported to DfT. Tension exists here: finance wants stable depreciation, engineering wants honest deterioration modelling which often shows accelerated aging on concrete sections (e.g., A14/A12).
  • Asset Data Quality Index (ADQI): The metric exposing the truth. Measures completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of asset data. Many legacy RIS1 schemes hold an ADQI below 80%, meaning Operations is maintaining the network based on assumptions rather than fact. Directly impacts the accuracy of 30-year renewal planning.
  • ORR Safety & Performance Review: Office of Rail and Road regulatory oversight. Scrutinizes NH's ability to predict asset failure. Poor ADMM compliance is a key finding in recent annual assessments, noting that NH cannot prove 'efficient expenditure' if it doesn't know the exact inventory of its assets.
  • Bridge Condition Index (BCI): The weighted average score of structure health. While the 'Average' BCI looks stable (approx 85-88), this masks a 'long tail' of critical sub-structures (piers, bearings) that are rated 'Poor' or 'Very Poor', posing operational risks to heavy load routes.
The key KPI reported to the ORR for structural health.
Current average (critical) score targets are under pressure due to the aging concrete stock from the 1970s motorway boom.
A drop in BCI triggers regulatory intervention.
Weighted average score of structural element condition.
Critical for prioritising structure renewals.
Current tension: Inspection data often lags real-time deterioration, particularly in post-tensioned concrete bridges on the strategic network.
The primary metric for structural asset health.
Currently trending downwards in several regions (Area 9, Area 10) as inflation erodes the real value of the RIS2 renewals budget, forcing a 'patch and mend' strategy.
The critical metric for structures.
We have a tension where 'Critical' BCI scores on minor overbridges are sometimes deprioritized to fund pavement renewals on the main carriageway to keep traffic moving (Journey Time Reliability).
Critical metric for structural health.
Declining BCI scores on legacy structures (e.g., M6 Thelwall Viaduct) trigger emergency funding requests that disrupt planned RIS portfolios.
The critical measure of structural health.
Currently showing a worrying decline in sub-structures on the M6 legacy viaducts (J5-J8).
Funding constraints in the RIS2 tail-end mean we are prioritizing 'holding repairs' over structural renewals, creating a massive life-cycle cost bomb for RIS4.
The weighted average score of structural health.
Currently trending downwards across the network due to the diversion of renewals funding to the Smart Motorway retrofit programme.
A critical hidden risk in the architecture.
Critical metric for structural assets.
Structures with low BCI scores should be prioritised, but often lose funding to 'visible' improvements like tarmac resurfacing which scores better with the public and DfT ministers.
The metric exposing the 'Opex/Capex' tension.
Structures falling below a certain BCI score should be maintained (Opex), but due to budget constraints, they are often left until they require full renewal, which allows them to be funded via the Capital (Renewals) budget.
Aggregated score of structural health derived from Principal Inspections.
Current tension: BCI is stable, but the backlog of 'latent defects' in post-tensioned structures is growing due to maintenance budget (Resource) cuts.
Weighted average of structure health.
A score below 40 triggers critical interventions.
Currently degrading on post-tensioned concrete viaducts from the 1970s.
Currently flagging critical risks on the M6 Thelwall Viaduct.
Tension exists between the Asset Directorate wanting full closures for deep repair and Operations Directorate refusing access due to diversion route saturation.
The critical structural health metric.
Currently trending red in Regions 1 and 2 due to deferred renewals.
The tension is between funding immediate patch repairs (Capital) vs.
long-term structural interventions (which disrupt the network).
Asset health metric.
Currently degrading in Region 1 (South West) due to funding diversion to Major Projects (LTC/A303).
Creates a 'fix on fail' culture rather than preventative maintenance.
  • Macpherson Review (NSIP Operational Reform): 2023 review assessing the failure/success of Project Speed. Concluded that while NH accelerated submission, the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) and Statutory Consultees (Natural England, Environment Agency) became the bottleneck. Shifted focus from 'squeezing the timeline' to 'paying for consultee resource'.
  • Whole Life Costing (WLC) Model: The theoretical financial model supposed to balance Capex and Opex. In reality, often manipulated using optimistic maintenance assumptions (e.g., underestimating traffic management costs for steel barrier tensioning) to justify Capex cuts.
  • WebTAG Appraisal (BCR Calculation): The Treasury Green Book aligned appraisal methodology. Calculates the Benefit-Cost Ratio. Tension point: WebTAG historically undervalues resilience and technology renewals compared to journey time savings, often skewing the Route Strategy pipeline towards capacity schemes rather than necessary operational technology upgrades.
  • Asset Condition (BCI & Skid Resistance): Critical inputs for RIS3. Bridge Condition Index (BCI) and SCRIM (skid resistance) data. We are seeing a 'red wall' of aging concrete assets from the 1970s. The architectural tension is funding this unsexy maintenance against political desires for ribbon-cutting new bypasses.
Critical safety metric derived from TRACS/SCANNER surveys.
If P50 drops below investigatory levels, speed restrictions (TS 10 temporary speeds) must be applied.
A lagging indicator that often forces unplanned reactive maintenance.
  • Scope 3 Supply Chain Carbon Baseline: The aggregate carbon footprint of the Extended Supply Chain. Data quality is low (confidence <0.6) because Tier 2/3 suppliers often estimate emissions using spend-based proxies rather than Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). This creates a 'blind spot' in the architecture where we report compliance to DfT based on modeled rather than actual data.
  • GG 104 Safety Risk Assessment (Innovation): The critical pass/fail node. Any new technology affecting the SRN must prove safety equivalence under DMRB GG 104. This is the primary bottleneck for AI/Machine Learning adoption, as deterministic safety cases struggle to validate non-deterministic probabilistic AI outputs.
The critical safety assurance process mandated by DMRB GG 104.
This assessment is currently a bottleneck for the M6 J21a-26 Smart Motorway upgrade, where the deviation from standard regarding Emergency Refuge Area (ERA) spacing is under intense scrutiny following the Transport Select Committee recommendations.
  • Micromobility Safety Evidence Stocktake (STATS19 Data): The accumulation of accident data derived from CRASH and COPA systems during the trials. Critical findings revealed a disproportionate severity of injuries at higher speeds (>15.5mph) and significant conflict points at uncontrolled crossings. For NH, the key metric was the 'pavement clutter' risk from delivery bots and the instability of e-scooters on high-speed A-road verges, directly influencing the rejection of 'free-floating' models near the SRN.
  • KPI: P50 (Clearance of Incidents): Operational metric measuring the time to clear 50% of incidents. Heavily scrutinized by ORR. Direct tension with 'Forensic Collision Investigation' requirements which require road closures to be maintained for police evidence gathering.
The Holy Grail metric: % of incidents cleared within 1 hour.
This drives behavior.
Traffic Officers may prioritize quick clearance (towing to hard shoulder) over forensic data collection, impacting root cause analysis.
  • Legacy Data Fragmentation Gap: The critical architectural debt. Asset data lives in HASS/IAM IS (static), traffic data in NTIS (dynamic), and major project data (A428, LTC) in BIM silos. There is no common data environment that currently satisfies the 'Single Source of Truth' requirement for a functioning Digital Twin.
  • P50 Network Availability Metric: Key RIS2 KPI. Measures the percentage of the network available to traffic. Incentivises delaying maintenance interventions to night-time only, which increases the cost of renewals and extends the deterioration of the asset base.
The percentage of the SRN available to traffic.
The 'God Metric' for Operations.
Often manipulated by scheduling roadworks at night, masking the true economic impact of lane closures.
Tends to conflict with the 'Safe and Serviceable' outcome.
Key KPI monitored by the ORR.
Major renewal schemes like the M25 J5-7 reconstruction negatively impact this metric, creating a perverse incentive for Operations Directorates to delay necessary renewals to protect quarterly performance stats.
Key performance indicator monitored by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR).
Construction roadworks (A66, LTC) negatively impact this, creating tension between Delivery Directorates (building new roads) and Operations (keeping lanes open).
The key performance indicator for journey reliability.
The Digital Twin is legally mandated to improve this metric by optimizing roadworks planning (Network Occupancy Management), but perverse incentives often prioritize spending budget over minimizing occupancy.
Key Performance Indicator for the DfT.
Measures the proportion of the network available to traffic.
Heavily incentivizes short, intense roadworks (Total Closures) over prolonged lane closures, often prioritizing metrics over local community disruption.
Key RIS2 KPI monitored by the ORR.
Measures the proportion of the network open to traffic.
NTIS availability directly impacts this score; if the system goes dark, we cannot prove the road is open.
This creates a perverse incentive to defer system maintenance to protect the KPI score.
The operational KPI measuring the probability that the transmission network is available 50% of the time?
No, in this context, it refers to the specific latency distribution targets required for safety-critical signalling.
The tension lies in the trade-off between bandwidth (high for video) and latency (low for signals), which fight for priority on the new HART fibre rings.
The primary DfT performance metric.
It incentivises keeping lanes open at all costs, which often forces Asset Management to defer deep maintenance in favour of shallow patching to avoid lane closures, creating a 'technical debt' timebomb.
Primary operational KPI.
Severely impacted when schemes open with 'temporary' traffic management remaining in place due to unfinished defects, dragging down regional performance scores despite the scheme technically being 'complete'.
Key RIS2/RIS3 performance indicator.
Measures percentage of traffic flowing freely.
Heavily manipulated by how 'roadworks' are classified vs 'emergency incidents'.
Drives perverse incentives to delay necessary maintenance to night shifts, increasing cost.
Key Performance Indicator for measuring journey reliability.
The primary driver for minimizing roadworks during peak hours, often conflicting with the need for deep maintenance interventions.
The primary KPI for journey reliability (97% target).
Tensions arise when routine maintenance (Operations) requests lane closures that threaten the metric, often leading to deferred maintenance and worsening pavement condition (LARS).
  • Smart Motorway Stocktake (2020/2022): The evidence review that effectively paused the All Lane Running (ALR) rollout. Changed the architectural direction from 'Capacity at low cost' to 'Safety retrofit regardless of cost'.
  • Technical Quality Score (0-100): Quantified metric derived from sub-criteria: Key Personnel (20%), Methodology (30%), Programme/Logic Links (15%), and Innovation/Lean delivery (5%). A score below 60 typically triggers a 'fail' condition regardless of price, safeguarding SRN resilience.
  • Collaborative Performance Framework (CPF) Scorecard: The primary metric for judging suppliers. Tracks KRA (Key Result Areas) across Safety (Home Safe and Well), Customer, and Delivery. NOTE: High scores here often mask underlying operational tensions regarding claim settlements and Compensation Events (CEs).
  • TOMs NT1 (Local Apprenticeships): Metric measuring number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) local apprentices hired. A difficult metric for schemes like Smart Motorway Alliance (SMA) retrofits where work is sporadic and mobile, making long-term apprenticeships hard to sustain.
  • TOMs NT19 (Spend with Local SMEs): Monetary value of spend with local Small to Medium Enterprises. This creates a perverse incentive where Tier 1s may break large packages into inefficient smaller chunks to hit this KPI, potentially risking programme P50 availability.
  • Disallowed Cost Identification: The specific evaluation of costs that NH refuses to pay under NEC4 (e.g., costs incurred due to defects, rework, or lack of substantiation). This is a high-conflict area where commercial auditors actively reject portions of the 'Application for Payment' submitted by the Delivery Integration Partners (DIPs).
  • GG 104 Safety Case / Safety Risk Assessment: The formal output documenting that safety risks have been reduced to ALARP. For Smart Motorways, this is the critical artifact reviewed by the ORR. It is often treated as a 'shelf-ware' document by delivery teams rather than a living operational tool, creating a dangerous disconnect.
  • Scope 1 & 2 Emissions KPI (tCO2e): Key Performance Indicator for corporate emissions. Heavily weighted towards electricity consumption for tunnel lighting/ventilation and the Traffic Officer fleet. Currently red-rated due to delays in depot EV charging infrastructure rollout.
  • Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR): Key metric reported to the ORR. While currently stable, it often masks 'walking wounded' or stress-related absence which doesn't get categorized as a 'site injury'.
  • Sickness Absence Rate (Mental Health): Rising metric within the Customer Service Group. correlates strongly with Smart Motorway scrutiny and increased public aggression towards roadside staff.
  • Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake: The critical post-mortem analysis of ALR (All Lane Running) safety data. This assessment effectively killed new Smart Motorway schemes and pivoted the entire architecture toward the ERA (Emergency Refuge Area) Retrofit Programme.
The critical post-mortem of All Lane Running (ALR) safety.
Relied heavily on comparative safety data from international networks to argue that ALR was statistically safer than conventional dual carriageways, despite public perception to the contrary.
The critical DfT outcome following the Transport Select Committee inquiry.
It froze ALR (All Lane Running) rollout and diverted funding toward SVD (Stopped Vehicle Detection).
This effectively de-funded several planned CAV expansion corridors to pay for immediate retrofit of radar SVD on existing M1 and M6 schemes.
The critical DfT analysis that effectively paused the rollout of new ALR schemes.
It forces a retrofit architecture (SVD, more ERAs) onto existing schemes, diverting capital from digital transformation initiatives.
The critical post-hoc assessment mandated by the Transport Select Committee.
It fundamentally altered the architecture of ALR schemes, forcing the retrofit of SVD technology and pausing the rollout of new ALR schemes pending safety data verification.
  • P50 Skid Resistance Metric: A critical safety KPI derived from SCANNER surveys. If P50 drops below investigatory levels, we have a statutory duty to intervene. This metric drives the surfacing renewal programme more than actual structural need, creating a 'worst-first' reactive maintenance culture.
  • KPI: P50 Journey Time Reliability: The primary customer promise in RIS2. Currently trending red due to the confluence of roadworks (A428, A66) and increased incident clearance times on Smart Motorways.
The metric measuring the planning time index.
Heavily influenced by long-term roadworks (WorkPackages).
The tension: Operations wants to lift roadworks to improve P50; Capital Delivery keeps them on to minimize mobilization costs.
The primary performance metric monitored by the ORR.
It measures the predictability of journey times.
Operationally, this metric drives perverse incentives—Regional Directors may prioritize keeping lanes open over necessary maintenance interventions to protect their P50 score, pushing asset degradation into the next RIS period.
Key KPI for the ORR and DfT.
Measures the consistency of journey times.
Operationally, this metric drives the focus on rapid incident clearance over long-term asset health, creating a perverse incentive to patch roads quickly rather than fix them properly.
Key RIS2 KPI measuring the 50th percentile of journey times.
Operational trade-off: Meeting this target encourages keeping lanes open during peak hours, which directly conflicts with the need to close lanes for essential defect rectification, leading to a deterioration of pavement condition (measured by TRACS).
Key performance indicator for RIS2.
There is a perverse incentive here: Closing a lane (Red X) for safety lowers the P50 score.
RCC operators must balance 'Keeping traffic moving' (Performance) vs 'Closing lanes for potential hazards' (Safety/Governance).
  • Defra Biodiversity Metric 4.0 Calculation: The specific spreadsheet-based calculation mechanism required to quantify 'Biodiversity Units'. Used on the A428 Black Cat and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine schemes. It converts UKHab survey data into unit values based on distinctiveness, condition, and strategic significance. A negative score stops the gateway process.
  • Skid Resistance (Scrim Coefficient): Safety critical data layer derived from SCANNER surveys. Areas falling below investigatory levels trigger CS 228 operational constraints (speed limits) until resurfacing occurs.
  • ADMM Data Quality Validation Score: Key Performance Indicator (KPI) measuring the percentage of asset data submitted by contractors that complies with ADMM syntax. Schemes frequently fail the initial P50 validation, leading to 'conditional acceptance' where we take ownership of the road but inherit dirty data, creating a long-tail liability for the regional maintenance teams.
  • Operational Metric: KPI P50 (Incident Clearance): Key Performance Indicator: Percentage of incidents cleared within 1 hour. Drives perverse behavior in RCCs, where operators may close lanes prematurely to 'secure the scene' and stop the clock, rather than attempting to keep traffic flowing, prioritizing the metric over journey time reliability.
  • Operational Compliance Verification (Inspection Body): External audit performed by an independent inspection body every 6 years. If the 'Administrative Authority' (DfT) does not sign off on this report based on TSO advice, the tunnel cannot legally operate. This is the 'nuclear option' in the governance structure that forces funding release for M&E assets over general carriageway defects.
  • GG 104 Safety Risk Assessment (SRA): The mandatory quantified risk assessment used to justify why legacy tunnels cannot meet modern CD 352 standards. It provides the legal cover for operating sub-standard geometry or aging systems by proving the risk is ALARP. A critical document for the Technical Assurance Authority (TAA).
The overarching safety risk standard.
The Principal Designer must prove that the design reduces risk to 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP).
Tensions arise when CDM 'elimination of hazard' conflicts with environmental constraints (e.g., noise barriers limiting visibility) on schemes like Lower Thames Crossing.
  • KPI: Skid Resistance (CS 228): Safety-critical metric derived from SCRIM surveys. Failure to meet investigatory levels defined in CS 228 triggers mandatory speed restrictions or lane closures, immediately impacting the P50 Availability metric. A tight coupling between asset condition and operational performance.
  • Supply Chain Hardware Trojan Risk: The threat of compromised microcode within the RSU communication modules (e.g., Quectel or Cinterion chips) introduced during manufacturing. We lack the deep-packet inspection capability at the edge to detect beaconing behaviour from compromised operational technology before it hits the National Roads Telecommunications Services (NRTS) network.
  • Operational Technology (OT) Cyber Security Capability Gap: Critical shortage of internal resource capable of securing roadside edge computing and V2X infrastructure against hostile state vectors. Current Traffic Officer Service (TOS) training covers physical safety (cones/tarmac) but omits digital asset protection. This creates a vulnerability surface on the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine digital twin pilot and threatens compliance with the NIS Directive.
  • Mode Confusion & Handover Risk: Operational assessment of the danger when drivers over-rely on ADAS (e.g., Lane Keep Assist) or misunderstand the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of current vehicle tech. This is the 'valley of death' for Level 3 autonomy. We are seeing this live on the M25 and M1 where drivers disengage, assuming the car/road is doing more than it can. A major tension point between vehicle marketing and actual infrastructure capability.
  • FTE vs Contractor Dependency Ratio: Metric tracking the balance between permanent staff and 'interim' supply chain resources (Tier 1 secondees). Highlights the perverse incentive where headcount caps force directorates to use CapEx budgets to hire expensive contractors for RIS3 planning (A66 Northern Trans-Pennine) to bypass Civil Service recruitment freezes.
  • Strategic Engineering Capability Attrition Rate: Specific measure of 'regrettable loss' in niche technical domains (ITS, bridge engineering, tunnel safety). We are currently bleeding talent to the supply chain (Amey, Balfour Beatty) who pay market rates that Civil Service pay bands cannot match, threatening our ability to act as an 'Intelligent Client' for DMRB governance.
  • EDI Senior Role Representation (2025 Targets): Tracks diversity specifically at Band 8 and SES (Senior Executive Service) levels against the 2025 Strategy. Currently shows a lag in operational leadership roles compared to corporate functions, creating a cultural disconnect between 'The Office' (The Cube/Bridge House) and the 'Outstations'.
  • Civil Service People Survey Engagement Index: The annual engagement score. Reveals significant variance between Major Projects Delivery (high engagement, clear mission on schemes like A303 Stonehenge) and Operations (lower engagement due to pay freezes and shift pressures). This metric is a lead indicator for union activity and potential industrial action.
  • ORR License Compliance Assessment: The periodic legal health-check determining if National Highways is meeting its conditions under the Road Investment Strategy (RIS). Failure here risks regulatory enforcement action from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), specifically regarding efficiency targets and safety performance (KPI 1).
  • ICO Decision Notices (Overturn Risk): The metric of failure for the Information Rights team. A high overturn rate by the Information Commissioner's Office on our redactions (specifically regarding environmental impact assessments for DCO applications) signals systemic non-compliance and reputational damage.
  • Accident Frequency Rate (AFR): Key KPI reported to ORR and DfT. Aggregates workforce injuries (NH and Supply Chain). Heavily influenced by large capital schemes (RIS2 delivery) and often lags behind leading indicators like Safety Inspection scores.
  • Occupational Health Anxiety/Stress Index: Internal metric tracking mental health-related absence. Currently trending negatively in Customer Service Division due to increased abuse from public regarding Smart Motorway reliability and delays.
  • Data Science vs. Civil Engineering Cultural Friction: Severe organizational tension. Traditional Asset Delivery directorates prioritize physical condition metrics (LARS, SCRIM) over predictive data analytics. This results in data silos where 'Smart' motorway radar data (stopped vehicle detection) is not effectively integrated with long-term asset degradation models, hindering the transition to predictive maintenance envisioned in RIS3.
  • Capital Programme Variance Analysis: The monthly 'truth telling' exercise. We compare actual spend (Work Done) against the baseline. Current operational reality: Inflation is causing significant variance on schemes like Lower Thames Crossing, forcing 'virement' (transfers) from Renewals budgets, degrading long-term asset health (P50 metrics).
  • KPI: Pavement Surface Condition (SAMI/SCANNER): Data derived from TRACS/SCANNER surveys. Used to justify maintenance funding. There is a lag of up to 18 months between survey and intervention, meaning the 'Red' condition reported to DfT is often already a pothole by the time funding arrives.
  • Residual Safety Risk Profile: The aggregate level of risk (probability x severity of collisions) remaining on the network after a scheme opens with approved departures. This metric directly impacts the P50 Network Availability and KSI (Killed or Seriously Injured) targets monitored by the ORR.
  • ORR Annual Assessment of Safety and Performance: The Office of Rail and Road's regulatory review. Their scrutiny of Smart Motorway safety data (stopped vehicle detection times) directly dictates operational priorities, often overriding internal strategic roadmaps to force immediate remedial works.
  • Smart Motorway Stocktake Evidence Assessment: A pivotal, ongoing assessment of safety data (stopped vehicle detection rates, response times) following the Transport Select Committee inquiry. This assessment directly dictates the operational risk profile for All Lane Running (ALR) sections like the M25 J23-27.
  • Asset Condition Score (LARS/SCANNER): Quantitative assessment of road surface condition derived from SCANNER surveys and stored in LARS (Lane Administration & Registration System). A declining score acts as a leading indicator for 'Safety Risk' and 'Service Availability Risk', triggering funding release from the Renewals budget.
  • P50 Pavement Condition Metric: Key KPI reported to the ORR. Measures the percentage of road surface requiring investigation. Operations teams often game this metric by prioritizing cheap surface dressing on 'Amber' condition roads rather than expensive deep reconstruction on 'Red' roads, due to annual budget cycles preventing multi-year asset strategies.
  • ORR RIS2 Performance Assessment: The external regulator's 'report card'. specifically targeting the KPI for 'P50 Network Availability'. Recent interventions regarding the validity of 'Technology Availability' metrics (excluding loop faults) have forced a re-architecture of how availability data is aggregated in the Business Intelligence layer.
  • Supply Chain Capacity & Inflation Analysis: Assessment of the construction market's ability to deliver NSIPs (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects) like the A428 Black Cat to Caxton Gibbet. High inflation impacts the 'Value for Money' cases for RIS3, forcing de-scoping of non-critical elements.
  • Geotechnical Asset Risk Profile (A66/M62): Critical evaluation of slope stability under saturation conditions. Focuses on peat slide risk on the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine route and chalk dissolution risks on the M25 J6-7. Utilizes GDMS (Geotechnical Data Management System) data, though relies heavily on legacy paper records for pre-1980 assets, creating a 'blind spot' in resilience planning.
  • Asset Condition Assessment (LARS/HAPMS): The ground truth of the network. Data from TRACS and SCANNER surveys fed into HAPMS/PAMS. When LARS (Lane Availability Reporting System) shows degradation, it triggers a statutory duty to intervene, forcing the Investment Decision Committee to divert funds from 'Shiny' enhancements (RIS) to 'Dull' maintenance (Renewals), creating friction with political promises.
  • Smart Motorway Stocktake 2020: The pivotal evidence review. It concluded ALR is statistically safer but public perception is broken. This assessment forced the cancellation of new ALR schemes in RIS3 planning.
The seminal event that shifted the architectural focus from 'Capacity at all costs' to 'Safety evidence first'.
It mandated the rollout of SVD and paused all new ALR schemes (M3 J9-14, etc.) until 5 years of safety data is proven.
  • Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) Metric: The paramount safety KPI monitored by DfT and ORR; the 2040 'Zero Harm' goal drives investment in costly central barrier replacements but conflicts with the budget cuts in routine maintenance.
The ultimate safety metric (Target: Zero Harm by 2040).
Operational reality: Statistical noise in KSI data makes short-term impact of interventions (like SVD) hard to prove to ORR.
  • Road Surface Skid Resistance (SCRIM/GripTester): Critical safety metric. Deteriorating scores on the strategic network are forcing reduced speed limits as a mitigation, masking the underlying funding gap for pavement renewals in the tail end of RIS2.
  • KPI: Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI): The ultimate safety metric (Target: Zero Harm). Lagging indicator. Recent spikes on Smart Motorways have driven the architectural pivot back towards physical infrastructure (more ERAs) rather than pure technology solutions.
The headline safety metric.
The 'Vision Zero' goal targets this.
The operational reality is that KSI stats often drive reactive safety schemes (e.g., barrier upgrades) at specific 'blackspots' rather than systemic network-wide treatments.
The primary lagging safety indicator.
Reporting is delayed by months due to the CRASH validation process with Police forces, making it useless for real-time operational steering at NTOC.
  • Corporate Risk: Supply Chain Inflation: Risk that RIS2/RIS3 committed schemes (A66, A46) become unaffordable due to construction inflation. This is forcing 'value engineering' (de-scoping) which often removes operational technology (CCTV density) to save capex, increasing long-term opex risk.
  • Smart Motorway Stocktake Evidence: The watershed assessment that altered operational architecture. It highlighted data gaps in stopped vehicle detection and forced a shift from 'capacity first' to 'safety assurance first', imposing retroactive constraints on ALR (All Lane Running) sections.
  • Structure Condition (BCI): Bridge Condition Index. Measures the degradation of structures. Many 1970s structures (M5 Oldbury, M6 Bromford) are deteriorating faster than funding allows for repair. This creates a 'hidden' operational risk where weight restrictions or lane closures may be imposed suddenly on strategic corridors.
  • RIS2 Efficiency & Inflation Review: ORR-led assessment of National Highways' ability to deliver the £27.4bn RIS2 capital programme. It highlights a massive trade-off: attempting to maintain the 'Road Period Efficiency' KPI while raw material costs for bitumen and steel have escalated, putting the A66 scheme's Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) at risk.
  • Cyber Security Maturity Assessment (NIS Directive): Compliance audit against the NIS Directive for Critical National Infrastructure (CNI). It reveals a high risk in 'Roadside OT'—specifically older CCTV and Message Signs in the South East region that are difficult to patch, creating a tension between operational uptime and security patching windows.
  • Gateway 3 (Investment Decision) Review: The critical 'Go/No-Go' point where the Full Business Case (FBC) is approved. This is the point of maximum friction. The tension lies between the fixed price needed for approval and the volatile construction inflation indices (Tender Price Index). Passing this gateway often requires 'Value Engineering' (scope reduction) which can compromise the original user benefits defined in the RIS2 commitment.
  • Smart Motorway Safety Evidence Stocktake 2020: The watershed moment for NH operations. Forced the admission that ALR 'safety' relied heavily on theoretical stats vs. public perception. Directly triggered the pause on new ALR schemes and mandated the SVD retrofit program.
  • Asset Resilience Risk Assessment (DMRB GG 104): Evaluation of safety risk using the ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) principle per GG 104. Currently flagging critical risks in drainage and geotechnical assets due to climate change. This assessment often reveals the funding gap between RIS2 distinct enhancements and the maintenance budget reality, impacting P50 Network Availability metrics.
  • National Road User Satisfaction Survey (NRUSS) Metrics: The official scorecard. It's heavily weighted by journey time and signage clarity. The 'Ageing Population' demographic consistently scores us lower on 'feeling safe', which directly impacts the ORR performance assessment.
  • KPI: P50 Network Availability: Primary RIS2/RIS3 performance metric monitored by ORR. Measures percentage of lanes available to traffic. Perverse incentive: Encourages delaying critical maintenance (renewal works) to keep lanes open, increasing long-term asset vulnerability and risk of catastrophic failure (e.g., concrete spalling).
Percentage of the network available to traffic.
Heavily impacted by roadworks.
This metric incentivizes 'lift and shift' maintenance (night work) which costs 30% more than 24-hour working, creating a tension with the Efficiency KPI.
Key performance metric measuring the average delay experienced by road users.
Currently trending Red/Amber due to high volume of roadworks (A428, M6) and incident clearance times.
Heavily influenced by the availability of lanes (LARS data).
The primary operational metric reported to ORR.
It measures the proportion of the network open to traffic.
It incentivises Operations to delay maintenance interventions (Roadspace Booking) to keep the score high, which ironically leads to worse asset condition (potholes) in the long run.
The primary operational metric for RIS2.
Measures the percentage of the network free from roadworks/incidents.
This creates a perverse incentive to delay necessary renewal works (pavement failures) to keep P50 high, pushing the 'asset maintenance bow wave' into RIS3.
The measure of the percentage of the network available to traffic.
This metric drives the scheduling of roadworks (WorkPackages).
It incentivizes delaying maintenance to night-time only, which extends project duration and cost, conflicting with the 'Efficiency' constraint.
The percentage of the SRN available to traffic, penalised by lane closures.
This metric creates perverse incentives: Asset delivery teams are pressured to delay necessary pavement renewals (to keep availability high) until surface failure becomes critical, forcing emergency repairs that are more disruptive.
The primary RIS2 KPI.
It incentivizes keeping lanes open.
This creates a perverse incentive to delay intrusive maintenance (like deep pavement reconstruction) in favor of surface patching, leading to long-term asset degradation.
  • SRN Radio Coverage Assessment (A66/A69): Operational reality check: Significant 'not-spots' exist on the Strategic Road Network, particularly the A66 and A69. In these zones, Traffic Officers operate without radio cover, relying on lone-worker safety protocols that are procedural rather than technological. This is a known risk in the operational safety case.
  • KPI: Network Availability (RIS2 Performance Framework): The statutory metric (target >97%) monitored by the ORR. Calculation: Total Lane-Kilometre-Minutes available / Total Lane-Kilometre-Minutes theoretical max. This metric drives perversity in operational behavior, forcing Maintenance & Response contracts to prioritize 'availability' over 'grouping of works', leading to inefficient, repeated visits to the same asset to avoid long-duration closures.
  • TRACS and SCRIM Data Analysis: Analysis of data from TRACS (TRAffic-speed Condition Surveys) and SCRIM (Sideway-force Coefficient Routine Investigation Machine) to determine the structural and surface health of the carriageway.
  • Strategic Road Network Customer Satisfaction Score: Key Performance Indicator (KPI) measuring driver satisfaction, derived from Transport Focus surveys, which influences regulatory grading by the ORR.

  • : The political pause on Smart Motorways is technically enforced through the inability to satisfy the GG 104 'Better or No Worse' safety criteria given current public and statistical scrutiny.
  • : Empowers the ORR to monitor NH. This relationship creates the 'Efficiency vs. Safety' tension, where ORR demands 'efficiency savings' (budget cuts) while simultaneously demanding better safety outcomes.
  • : The deadly trade-off. To keep Availability (KPI) high, access for Pavement Renewals is restricted. This leads to deteriorating Asset Condition (LARS), which eventually forces emergency closures, hurting Availability even more. A negative feedback loop.

  • : Triggers the deployment of Snow Blowers and Ploughing units specifically to Stainmore Summit. High operational risk: If gritters get stuck in traffic on the single carriageway sections, the road is lost.
  • : Regulatory Gate: The ORR report findings on previous ALR schemes act as a blocking constraint for the M6 upgrade, preventing 'Notice to Proceed' until safety evidence exceeds DMRB GG 104 baseline.

  • : The operational performance of these devices generates the casualty data. The relationship highlights the tension between 'innovation' and 'trauma'—specifically the finding that small wheel diameters react poorly to standard SRN pavement maintenance tolerances.
  • : IAM IS contributes to the gap by locking asset condition data in a structure designed for 5-year renewal planning, not real-time operational availability.

  • : Operations Directorate is associated with the Residual Safety Risk because they are the final owners of the asset. They must adapt operational procedures (e.g., lowering variable speed limits via MIDAS) to mitigate the risks introduced by design departures accepted during the capital phase.
  • : The ORR monitors the cumulative impact of residual risks across the SRN to ensure National Highways is not systematically degrading safety margins to meet RIS2 efficiency targets.
  • : Governs the design approval. Tension arises because the scheme was costed before recent GG 104 updates regarding 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) interpretations for technology failure modes.
  • : The 'Throw it over the wall' relationship. MP delivers capital schemes like A428. Operations inherits the maintenance liability. There is often a disconnect between the 'As Built' data provided by MP supply chains and the asset data standards required by Operations.
  • : The stocktake results directly validate whether the SVD targets are being met. Discrepancies here (e.g., false alarms overloading NTOC) create a 'Compliance Risk' with the ORR and a 'Reputational Risk' with the Transport Select Committee.
  • : The DfT uses the PCF Gateways as financial choke points. They will not release capital funding (CapEx) for the next stage until the Assurance Report confirms compliance with the Client Scheme Requirements. This is a control relationship disguised as governance.
  • : The assessment highlights the gap between current asset condition (often failing) and the aspirational standards set in CG 501. This gap represents a massive unfunded liability in the operational architecture.
  • : Grid constraints at MSAs effectively block RCF deployment. Creates a dependency on Ofgem regarding who pays for the 'last mile' connection.
  • : The ORR actively scrutinises such initiatives to ensure NH isn't distracted from core maintenance duties or exploiting its monopoly position.
  • : The primary driver for the LTC. The Dartford Crossing is the single biggest point of failure for the UK logistics network due to urban sprawl in Kent and Essex. LTC is the architectural release valve.
  • : The existence and spacing of ERAs is the single biggest factor in the confidence of disabled motorists using Smart Motorways. The current programme to reduce spacing to 1 mile is a direct concession to this stakeholder group's anxiety.
  • : Major Projects 'calls off' from the RDP. They are the users of the contract, but they are often frustrated by the rigidity of the Model Contract Document (MCD) when facing unique site challenges.
  • : The 'Throw it over the wall' relationship. MP delivers capital schemes like A428. Operations inherits the maintenance liability. There is often a disconnect between the 'As Built' data provided by MP supply chains and the asset data standards required by Operations.
  • : SES owns GG 104 and uses it as the primary governance lever to reject non-compliant designs from Major Projects, creating a necessary but adversarial check-and-balance.
  • : HART ingests LARS/SCANNER data to model degradation; however, data quality issues from legacy surveys mean HART's predictions often clash with Regional Engineers' on-ground assessments.
  • : ORR pressure and the Transport Select Committee inquiry forced the creation of this retrofit package, effectively reallocating budget from other enhancements.
  • : The funding constraints of RIS2 are clashing with the inflationary reality of LTC, forcing value-engineering decisions that may compromise the final tunnel operating systems.
  • : Operational Friction: HART is the technical anchor preventing the realization of Digital Roads. Its rigid, localized architecture prevents the exposure of real-time signal data APIs required for In-Vehicle Signage (IVS) trials.
  • : Regulatory Friction: ORR holds NH accountable for the SVD effectiveness stats. The 80% detection target drives massive operational pressure on RCCs to validate alerts, often leading to distinct differences between 'reported' performance and 'actual' operational utility.
  • : The Stocktake forced an accelerated review of safety standards, bypassing some of the usual bureaucratic inertia due to political pressure from the Transport Select Committee.
  • : The LTC team generates thousands of documents for the DCO. The rigidity of this legal process means the operational architecture (tunnels, control systems) is being defined now, potentially locking in obsolescent technology by the time it opens in 2030+.
  • : Feedback loop: Rising KSI stats (particularly on Smart Motorways) lead to stricter interpretation of GG 104, making it harder to deploy 'Digital Roads' initiatives without massive physical redundancy.
  • : GG 104 dictates the methodology for designing controls. If a design (e.g., gantry spacing on the A14) deviates from GG 104, a formal 'Departure from Standard' is required, which escalates the risk rating immediately.
  • : The stocktake results directly validate whether the SVD targets are being met. Discrepancies here (e.g., false alarms overloading NTOC) create a 'Compliance Risk' with the ORR and a 'Reputational Risk' with the Transport Select Committee.
  • : The A428 delivery team must demonstrate compliance with GG 104. Friction arises when design changes (value engineering) require new ALARP assessments, delaying the schedule.
  • : When OT systems fail, the process relies entirely on human intervention by Traffic Officers, creating a capacity bottleneck.
  • : Funding dependency. The immense capital requirement of LTC exerts pressure on the entire RIS3 portfolio, potentially cannibalizing budgets for smaller safety schemes or digital upgrades (Road to Zero Harm).
  • : HART is the primary focus of the NIS Directive assurance because it introduces cloud-native control of road assets, moving the risk boundary from physical roadside cabinets to the Azure cloud, requiring a totally different audit skillset.
  • : The DfT uses the PCF Gateways as financial choke points. They will not release capital funding (CapEx) for the next stage until the Assurance Report confirms compliance with the Client Scheme Requirements. This is a control relationship disguised as governance.
  • : The scheme design must demonstrate compliance with GG 104. Any 'Departures from Standard' to save costs during construction must pass this safety governance, often causing friction between commercial teams and safety assurance.
  • : Friction point: LTC design innovation often conflicts with rigid GG 104 requirements, necessitating complex 'Departures from Standards' applications.
  • : SES owns the methodology (GG 104) used for resilience assessments. There is friction here: Operations often feels the standards are too rigid and don't account for the pragmatic reality of keeping the network running under pressure.
  • : The DAMP is theoretically built upon HADDMS data, but the poor data quality (missing culvert locations on A-roads) forces the plan to rely on extrapolated assumptions rather than verified asset condition.
  • : The assessment highlights the gap between current asset condition (often failing) and the aspirational standards set in CG 501. This gap represents a massive unfunded liability in the operational architecture.
  • : Grid constraints at MSAs effectively block RCF deployment. Creates a dependency on Ofgem regarding who pays for the 'last mile' connection.
  • : The Treasury/DfT drive the requirement for revenue replacement (Road User Pricing), pushing NH to architect a technical solution for a political problem.
  • : The ORR actively scrutinises such initiatives to ensure NH isn't distracted from core maintenance duties or exploiting its monopoly position.
  • : The primary driver for the LTC. The Dartford Crossing is the single biggest point of failure for the UK logistics network due to urban sprawl in Kent and Essex. LTC is the architectural release valve.
  • : SVD implementation is the primary mitigation evidence used in GG 104 safety cases to justify All Lane Running (ALR) operations. If SVD performance drops (rain fade), the GG 104 safety argument collapses.
  • : IDC provides oversight to ensure developer-funded schemes do not introduce long-term operational liabilities (OpEx) that outweigh the initial capital contribution (CapEx).
  • : Rijkswaterstaat co-developed the CHARM architecture, providing the reference model that NH is attempting to implement for its future control room systems.
  • : The CHARM programme is the intended replacement for HART. The relationship is characterized by friction: delays in CHARM functionalities (especially regarding SVD integration) necessitate life-extension works on HART.
  • : HART is the legacy baseline for the SIMS modernisation work package. The trade-off driving this is the high cost of maintaining the current customised SaaS instance versus the need for modern API capabilities to support a 'Digital Twin' of safety risk.
  • : Mandates financial transparency, preventing the DIP from using supply chain payments to prop up their own balance sheet.
  • : The ongoing regulatory negotiation to protect the ITS band from Wi-Fi encroachment, critical for future RIS3 connected corridor schemes.
  • : Quantifies the safety risk to Traffic Officers operating in dead zones.
  • : The concrete roads programme is a specific sub-portfolio constrained by the specific funding ring-fenced within the RIS2 budget.
  • : The ORR formally monitors National Highways' performance against the Pavement Condition KPI as part of its regulatory function.
  • : The damage assessment process often runs in parallel or coordination with the NVRM removing the vehicle to reveal damage to the carriageway.
  • : Supports safety by managing the rectification of Category 1 defects (e.g., potholes, barrier damage) within prescribed DMRB timeframes.
  • : The inspection process must adhere strictly to the intervals and reporting standards defined in DMRB CS 450.
  • : All planned renewal schemes must demonstrate ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) safety risk profiles per GG 104.
  • : GG 104 governs the engineering capability by mandating the safety risk assessment methodology used for all SRN design changes.
  • : SES Directorate owns the governance and standards (GG 119) that dictate how the Road Safety Audit process is executed.
  • : The ORR monitors the Customer Satisfaction Score assessment to validate National Highways' compliance with RIS2/RIS3 performance specifications.
  • : DfT publishes the RIS2, which acts as the primary mandate and funding envelope for the CIP Value Stream.
  • : GDMS is the specific repository associated with the inspection capability for earthworks and geotechnical assets.
  • : The RIS2 document defines the specific performance metric target for pavement condition.
  • : The RIS funding envelope and performance specification drives the scope and timing of the Enhance Network value stream.
  • : The booking process is constrained by the RIS2 availability targets (minimizing occupancy).
  • : Signal setting processes must adhere to safety risk assessments defined in GG 104.
  • : RDP contractors are the primary subject of the collaborative performance monitoring process.
  • : DfT defines and publishes the RIS, which acts as the instruction for NH.
  • : Monitoring activities are measured against the KSI reduction requirement.

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSACTOR (114 components):
--------------------------------------
  • DfT Roads Strategy Division (RSD): The specific DfT unit acting as the Client for the Road Investment Strategy (RIS). They hold the ultimate veto on Programme Business Cases (PBC) for Tier 1 schemes like Lower Thames Crossing and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine. They do not just provide oversight; they control the 'Statements of Funds Available' (SoFA) release triggers.
  • HM Treasury Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA): The external assurance body conducting 'Gate Reviews' (0-5). A 'Red' or 'Amber/Red' rating from IPA on a major scheme like the A428 Black Cat to Caxton Gibbet effectively freezes funding release, regardless of NH's internal readiness or contractor mobilization.
  • National Highways Investment Committee (IC): The internal gatekeeper for Tier 2 (£100m-£500m) and Tier 3 (<£100m) investments. Theoretically holds the kill switch, but rarely cancels schemes explicitly named in the Road Investment Strategy (RIS) due to ORR regulatory penalties for missed commitments.
  • Operations Directorate (National Network): The entity holding the 'License to Operate'. They are the duty holders for the SRN. They inherit assets from Major Projects often without the requisite OpEx uplift to maintain them. They run the RCCs and manage the Traffic Officer Service.
The end-users of the H&S File.
They maintain the asset post-delivery.
They are currently struggling with the 'digital gap'—receiving complex smart motorway assets without the requisite digital twins or updated maintenance manuals in the asset management system.
  • Major Projects Directorate (Complex Infrastructure): Responsible for delivering Tier 1 schemes (A428, A66, LTC). They operate under immense pressure to hit 'Start of Works' dates to satisfy DfT RIS commitments, sometimes leading to 'value engineering' that strips out operational resilience features to stay within budget, passing technical debt to Operations.
Delivery arm responsible for RIS2/RIS3 Tier 1 schemes (A303 Stonehenge, A66 Northern Trans-Pennine).
Acts as the functional 'Client', ensuring F10 notification to HSE, though often relies on delivery partners for actual competence checks.
The 'build' arm of the organisation, currently navigating the DCO (Development Consent Order) minefield for the Lower Thames Crossing.
Operationally siloed from Operations, creating a 'throw it over the fence' culture where assets are delivered with high capital efficiency but poor maintainability (e.g., poor access to roadside technology cabinets).
  • Operations Directorate (National Highways): The operational arm managing the SRN (Strategic Road Network). Responsible for real-time traffic management via RCCs and on-road officers. Operates in tension with Major Projects, often inheriting 'value-engineered' assets that are expensive to maintain.

They manage the tension between the 'ring-fenced' roads fund and the reality of inflationary pressure on raw materials (bitumen, steel) for renewal schemes.
  • Major Projects Delivery Directorate (MP): Responsible for delivering RIS2 and RIS3 enhancements like the A428 and A66. Culturally distinct from Operations; prioritizes schedule and capital spend (CAPEX) over long-term maintainability. Often pushes assets through 'Practical Completion' with outstanding defects that Operations must resolve.
Responsible for capital delivery (RIS2/RIS3).
Incentivized primarily on time/cost/quality of physical construction.
Often views ADMM compliance as a secondary administrative burden.
Contracts (NEC4) historically lacked punitive clauses for poor data quality.
The capital delivery arm for RIS2 and RIS3 schemes.
Often operates in a silo from Operations, creating a 'throw it over the wall' culture where asset data (ADMM) compliance is sacrificed for schedule adherence.
Responsible for NSIPs and DCO applications.
Responsible for delivering RIS2/RIS3 enhancements like A428 Black Cat and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine.
Historically focused on 'pavement down' delivery dates over data quality, creating friction with Operations who inherit asset liabilities.
The directorate responsible for NSIPs (A66 Northern Trans-Pennine, etc.).
They consume the vast majority of Systems Engineering resources, creating resource contention with Operations who need similar skills for renewing legacy tunnel control systems.
The 'Applicant' for National Highways.
Responsible for delivering RIS2/RIS3 commitments (A428, A66, LTC).
Often creates tension with Operations Directorate by designing assets that are compliant for planning but expensive to maintain (e.g., complex drainage solutions).
  • Future Roads Division (Strategy & Planning Directorate): The central architectural authority owning the Route Strategy process. They sit in The Cube (Birmingham) and effectively referee between the Regional Operations Directors (who want maintenance budget) and the Major Projects (RIP) teams (who want new schemes). They are responsible for producing the SRNIR but struggle with inconsistent data granularity from the Regions.
  • Capital Portfolio Management Office (CPMO): The central assurance authority within National Highways responsible for enforcing the Project Control Framework (PCF) and coordinating Integrated Assurance Reviews (IAR). They act as the primary interface between Major Projects delivery teams and the DfT Investment Committee for Tier 1 schemes.

The independent monitor of National Highways, responsible for holding the company to account for delivery of RIS2/RIS3 efficiency, performance, and customer satisfaction targets.
The independent monitor responsible for assessing National Highways' performance and efficiency in delivering CIP schemes against the RIS Performance Specification.
The independent monitor that assesses National Highways' performance against RIS Performance Specifications (KPIs) and efficiency targets.
  • National Highways Board: The supreme decision-making body accountable to the Secretary of State for Transport. They don't manage daily ops; they manage political risk and RIS2/RIS3 solvency. They are currently obsessed with the reputational fallout from the Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake and the deliverability of the £27bn RIS2 envelope amidst inflation. They sign off the Annual Report and Accounts but rely heavily on sub-committees to filter the noise from the operational directorates.
Ultimately accountable to DfT.
They sit between the political pressure of the Minister (Roads Minister) and the operational reality of the network.
They sign off on the DCO applications.
  • Investment Decision Committee (IDC): The internal National Highways executive body holding delegated authority for investment decisions. They review Stage Gate Assessment Reviews (SGARs). Tensions often arise here between Operations directors needing P50 network availability and Major Projects directors pushing for scheme start dates.
The internal governance body where the real trade-offs happen.
They balance the RIS2/RIS3 committed schemes against the shrinking 'headroom' caused by construction inflation.
Often forced to make 'least worst' decisions on deferring renewals to protect major project milestones.
The internal governance body where architectural purity dies.
They adjudicate the trade-offs between ORR efficiency targets (KPIs) and engineering reality.
Currently prioritizing schemes that deliver immediate Safety (Smart Motorway retrofit) over long-term Capacity, driven by the Stocktake evidence.
  • Regional Control Centre (RCC) - Godstone  (South East - Areas 4, 5, 8): Operational nerve centre for the M25 and South East. Staffed by Traffic Officers and Control Room Operators who rely on legacy CCTV and incoming SVD alerts to manage the highest traffic volumes on the network. Acts as the escalation point for 'Red X' compliance enforcement.

They deal with the actual alarm fatigue from SVD (Stopped Vehicle Detection) radar false positives on the M25 and have to manually validate incidents that NTIS algorithms miss.
Operational hub for the M25 South East quadrant.
The 'human in the loop' dealing with the reality of SVD technology - facing high cognitive load due to false alarm rates from radar detection systems during bad weather.
South East regional hub responsible for the M25 and high-density radial routes (M23, M3).
Operational reality involves constant friction between local incident management decisions and NTOC strategic overrides.
Primary user of the Command & Control (C&C) system and first line of defence for Smart Motorway incident management.
Operational nerve centre for the M25 orbital and South East.

The operational hub for the South East (M25).
They manage the highest density of Smart Motorway incidents.
The operators here are the human firewall between system alerts and deploying Traffic Officers.
South East regional control handling the M25 and high-density radial routes.
Operators here manage the tension between keeping traffic flowing (P50 targets) and closing lanes for safety (Red X compliance), often battling false alarms from SVD systems.
M25 control hub.
Represents the operational frontline where policy meets reality.
Operators here often bypass official protocols to keep the M25 moving, using local workarounds for signal setting when the national system dictates unsafe or illogical speeds.
Specific control centre managing the M25 and South East quadrant.
Operates at higher tempo than other RCCs due to Lower Thames Crossing interfaces and high density of All Lane Running (ALR) smart motorway sections (M25 J23-27).
Critical point of failure if CHARM rollout destabilises legacy communications.
Controls the busiest section of the M25.
The operators here are the primary users of SVD alerts.
There is significant 'alert fatigue' here; when SVD radar triggers too many false alarms during rain, operators may mentally downgrade the urgency of alerts, a critical human-factor risk in the architecture.
Critical operational hub managing the M25 South East quadrant.
Operates at high tension between RIS2 performance targets (P50 journey time reliability) and the reality of Smart Motorway interventions.
Staff are currently overwhelmed by 'ghost' alerts from retrofitted SVD radar systems, creating alert fatigue that risks missing genuine stopped vehicles.

South East regional operations hub.
While NTOC handles strategy, Godstone deals with the high-density M25 traffic.
Operational friction exists here: they use local instances of command tools that don't always sync perfectly with the National view in real-time, creating a 'fog of war' during major incidents like Operation Stack or unexpected tunnel closures.
Responsible for tactical deployment of Traffic Officers and setting signals on the busiest section of the SRN.
Operators here face high cognitive load managing conflicting alerts from MIDAS and SVD (Stopped Vehicle Detection) systems.

South East operational hub managing the M25 and high-density radial routes.
Operators facing cognitive overload from high Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) false alarm rates on Smart Motorway sections.
Operational staff responsible for signal setting and incident management.
Tension: Must balance ORR mandates for 'verified' incidents before setting Red X against the immediate safety risk of stalled vehicles in live lanes on Smart Motorways.
  • West Midlands RCC Operator (Quinton): The human 'swivel-chair' interface responsible for validating incoming alerts before setting 'Red X' signals (TSRGD compliance). Operational constraint: Cognitive load is maxed out during peak flows; operators must visually verify SVD alerts via CCTV before signal setting to avoid litigation, creating a critical dependency on CCTV P50 availability.
  • RCC Godstone Control Room Operator: Operational staff managing the M25 South East quadrant. Responsible for interpreting SVD alerts. High cognitive load due to 'ghost' alerts. They hold the specific delegation to set Red X signals under TSRGD requirements.
Operational staff responsible for the M25/A3 corridor.
Must cognitively switch between standard motorway traffic management and specific tunnel safety protocols defined in the Local Operating Agreement.
  • On-Road Traffic Officer Service (TOS): Frontline responders patrolling specific beats (e.g., M6 J13-J15). Operational tension exists here: they are dual-tasked with 'Customer Service' and 'Safety Critical Response,' often under-resourced during peak flows leading to missed KPIs.
  • RCC Quinton (West Midlands Control Centre): Operational hub managing the M6 Smart Motorway corridor. Houses the specific desk dispatchers who own the decision rights for TO deployment. Friction point: Tensions often arise between RCC Quinton's tactical lane closure needs and NTOC's strategic requirement to keep the M6 flowing for national freight logistics.
  • Traffic Officer Service (TOS) Operations: The operational workforce comprising ~1,900 uniformed staff responsible for incident management on the SRN. Currently facing a critical trade-off: delivering the '10-minute response time' commitment for Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) alerts on All Lane Running (ALR) sections while managing a 12-15% regional attrition rate (particularly in South East regions like Godstone). Operational capacity is heavily constrained by the 'Smart Motorway Stocktake' commitments vs. flat operational expenditure (OpEx) settlements in RIS2/RIS3.
  • NTOC (National Traffic Operations Centre) Quinton Team: The strategic command hub responsible for the Strategic Road Network (SRN) overview. They manage the 'Strategic diversion routes' when major incidents close links like the M62 Trans-Pennine. They are distinct from Regional Control Centres (RCCs) but depend entirely on the same Common Operational Picture (COP) provided by NTIS. If NTIS latency exceeds 2 minutes, their ability to coordinate cross-regional diversions collapses.
  • Road User (Commercial & Freight): Logistics operators heavily reliant on journey time reliability (BIT - Budgeted Impact Time). They bypass official VMS information in favour of third-party telematics which often route HGVs onto inappropriate local roads when the SRN is congested, causing friction with Local Highway Authorities.
  • Telent (NRTS Operator): Operates the fibre/copper roadside network. Critical dependency for all Smart Motorway signals. Maintenance windows for NRTS often conflict with operational needs; a fibre cut on the M62 can blind the Wakefield RCC, forcing a reversion to manual patrols and 60mph fixed limits.
  • SDF Community (Scheme Delivery Framework): The supply chain ecosystem delivering renewals. The architectural tension lies in the commercial model: incentives for speed sometimes conflict with data quality requirements (ADMM) at handover, leaving NH with 'orphan assets' in the database.
  • Regional Engineering Stewards: Senior engineers in Operations directorates (e.g., East, South West) who hold the delegated authority to sign off technical standards deviations (Departures). They often reject centrally modeled renewal recommendations based on 'local knowledge', creating a disconnect between the National Asset Needs plan and actual delivery.
  • Operations Directorate (OD): The asset receiver. Responsible for maintenance (Regionally via ADs) and traffic management (NTOC/RCCs). They bear the long-term risk of poor data; if pavement depths are unrecorded in HAPMS, they cannot accurately forecast TWP (Treatment Works Programme) budgets.
The 'poor relation' regarding funding but holds the statutory duty for network availability.
Manages RCCs, Traffic Officers, and maintenance via ASC/AD contracts.
Inherits high-tech assets from MP (like smart motorways) without proportional OPEX uplifts for software maintenance.
The custodian of the SRN responsible for real-time traffic management (Traffic Officers), maintenance, and renewals; currently struggling with aging assets and the resource drain of the Smart Motorway Safety Retrofit programme diverting funds from pavement renewals.
The primary First Line actor responsible for the Strategic Road Network (SRN) real-time performance.
manages the Traffic Officer Service, RCCs (e.g., Godstone, Quinton), and maintains asset availability (P50 metrics).
They own the immediate safety risk during incidents.
The National Highways directorate responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the SRN, managing the Maintenance and Response (M&R) contracts and Regional Operations Centres (ROCs).
  • Regional Engineering & Asset Teams (OD/SES): The decision-makers in the regions (e.g., South East, Midlands) who validate model outputs. They frequently override dTIMS recommendations based on local intelligence (e.g., knowing a specific batch of aggregate on the A14 is polishing faster than predicted).

Their scrutiny forces National Highways into a defensive data-cleansing posture rather than purely proactive network management.
  • Operations Directorate (Regional Control Centres): The 'customer' of the roadworks. RCCs (e.g., Godstone, Quinton) deny road space bookings if suppliers fail NOMS compliance. There is significant friction here: Suppliers want access to build; Operations wants 97% availability (P97) and zero erratic lane closures.
The actual operators (Traffic Officers and RCC controllers at Godstone, Wakefield, etc.) who inherit the 'residual risk' of any design departures approved during construction.
They must manage the SRN using systems like HART and CHARM, dealing with the operational reality of compromised geometry (e.g., lack of hard strips) long after the project team has disbanded.

Struggle point: Information asymmetry between local Tunnel Control Rooms and the strategic overview at RCC, often leading to delayed implementation of widespread diversions during 'Red X' compliance events.
Operational hub managing the busiest section of the SRN.
Operators here face the direct conflict between 'Keeping Traffic Moving' (KTM) pressures and the strict risk parameters of Red X enforcement under TSRGD.
  • RCC Godstone Operations Team: Traffic Officers and Control Room Operators responsible for the M25/A282 and A3 corridor. They rely on the SCADA HMI to manage tunnel incidents. Friction point: They often bypass the digital HMI controls in favour of physical emergency buttons if the GUI lags, skewing data capture.
24/7 control room staff responsible for M25 SE quadrant and M23.
Heavily reliant on CHARM/Dynac for incident management.
Operates under high cognitive load due to Radar SVD (Stopped Vehicle Detection) false alarms on ALR sections.
Critical decision makers for Red X compliance enforcement.
  • East Regional Control Centre (South Mimms): Operational hub responsible for monitoring M25 North tunnels. Operators rely on legacy SCADA interfaces that lack integration with modern HART (Highways Analyst and Real-time Traffic) systems, forcing manual interventions during incident responses.
  • Ofcom: Regulatory body controlling the 5.9GHz band. NH must lobby continuously to prevent Wi-Fi expansion (RLAN) from bleeding into the ITS safety band. A friction point where national connectivity policy clashes with transport safety needs.
  • Regional Control Centre (RCC Godstone): M25 operational hub. Responsible for tactical incident management on the busiest orbital. Operators here frequently bypass NTOC protocols to manage 'red signals' based on local visual confirmation rather than NTIS algorithmic recommendations. High friction point for implementation of coherent national traffic policy.
  • Regional Operations Director (Statutory Tunnel Manager): The legal 'Tunnel Manager' defined in the Regulations. While they hold the legal accountability, they lack the technical bandwidth to manage daily M&E systems. They delegate duties to the Service Delivery Manager, creating a 'delegation of authority' risk gap where strategic funding decisions (RIS2/RIS3) may conflict with specific statutory maintenance requirements flagged by the TSO.
  • Supply Chain Tier 1 Contractors: Major delivery partners (Balfour Beatty, Costain, Skanska) holding the actual technical CAV expertise. This creates a principal-agent problem where National Highways lacks the internal skills to effectively assure the quality of V2X digital deliverables on schemes like the A303 Stonehenge.
Balfour Beatty, Skanska, Costain, etc., who deliver 95% of the actual work.
We rely on their Scope 1/2 data to report our Scope 3.
The commercial model (NEC4) needs stronger incentives for carbon reduction, as current pain/gain share focuses predominantly on cost/time.
  • Human Resources and Organisational Development Directorate: The central function managing the 5,500+ internal FTE workforce while navigating the complex tension between Civil Service constraints and the commercial agility required to deliver RIS2 schemes like the A428 Black Cat and Lower Thames Crossing. They own the tension between OpEx-funded internal staff and CapEx-funded Project Management Framework (PMF) contractors.
  • External Legal Panel (Tier 1 Firms): The cadre of external solicitors (e.g., DLA Piper, Womble Bond Dickinson, etc.) who provide surge capacity for mega-projects. While operationally necessary, their distance from NH internal data systems (NTIS, SHARE) often leads to duplication of effort and billing friction regarding 'knowledge transfer' back to the in-house General Counsel.
  • Corporate Affairs and Communications Directorate: The operational function managing reputational risk and statutory stakeholder engagement. This is not just 'PR'; it is the defensive shield for the RIS2 capital programme (£27.4bn) against intense scrutiny from the Transport Select Committee and the 'Roads Policing Review'. They manage the tension between DfT political messaging and the engineering reality of scheme delays (e.g., A428 Black Cat, A66 Northern Trans-Pennine).
  • National Press Office (Guildford/Birmingham): 24/7 responsive media handling unit. They act as the buffer for the Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake fallout, managing reactive statements regarding stopped vehicle detection (SVD) performance and radar coverage statistics. They rely on imperfect real-time data from Regional Control Centres (RCCs) to counter negative press narratives during incidents.
  • Audit and Risk Assurance Committee (ARAC): Non-executive body responsible for challenging the Executive on the reality of the Corporate Risk Register versus operational truth. Currently focused heavily on the gap between RIS3 efficiency assumptions and actual inflation impacts on schemes like A66 and Lower Thames Crossing.
Non-Executive Director led committee providing independent scrutiny of the Executive's management of the Corporate Risk Register.
Specifically focused on 'Red' risks affecting the RIS2/RIS3 delivery commitments and statutory safety duties under the Highways Act 1980.
Board-level committee providing the ultimate internal oversight.
They receive reports from Internal Audit and External Audit (NAO).
They are currently heavily focused on the financial risks of inflation on the RIS3 capital delivery programme.
  • Corporate Assurance Division (Third Line of Defence): Internal audit function. Currently under resource strain attempting to audit the efficacy of the 'Performance Recovery Plan' mandated by the ORR. They expose the disconnect between 'policy' (what we say we do) and 'practice' (what RCC operators actually do during high workload).
  • Information Rights and Compliance Team (The Cube, Birmingham): The gatekeepers located in Birmingham. They don't just 'process' requests; they actively triage risks involving the Press Office. They are currently overwhelmed by requests regarding Smart Motorway stoppage data derived from the 'Stocktake' commitments and ORR scrutiny.
  • National Audit Office (NAO) Transport Audit Team: The external auditors who hold the power to freeze decision-making. Their recent 'Value for Money' studies on the RIS2 enhancements portfolio have forced a re-evaluation of the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine business case. They don't just read reports; they interview SROs.
  • Public Accounts Committee (PAC): The ultimate accountability tribunal. When RIS2 delivery slips (as seen with the delays to the A428 Black Cat scheme), the Chief Executive is summoned here. The preparation for these hearings paralyzes the Executive Committee for weeks.
  • A428 Black Cat Delivery Partner: Supply chain partner (Skanska) executing the A428 Black Cat to Caxton Gibbet scheme. Subject to NH safety passporting and Common Intent Document requirements, often creating friction with their own corporate safety management systems.
  • M&R (Maintenance & Response) Contractor: The commercial entity (e.g., Amey, Balfour Beatty) actually doing the work. They are caught in the crossfire: paid by Asset Management outcomes, but directed daily by RCC Operations demands.
Supply chain partners (e.g., Amey, Balfour Beatty, Kier) responsible for executing physical works under Asset Delivery contracts.
  • Major Projects Complex Infrastructure Programme: The delivery directorate responsible for NSIPs like the Lower Thames Crossing and A303 Stonehenge. They are driven by RIS2/RIS3 delivery milestones and CPI (Cost Performance Index) targets, creating a direct incentive tension against the conservative safety margins mandated by SES.
Delivery body responsible for LTC and A303 Stonehenge.
Architecturally decoupled from Operations (customer service), leading to 'throw over the fence' risks where complex CAV infrastructure is delivered without sufficient OPEX budget for ongoing HART integration.
  • Regional Control Centres (RCC) Collective: The tactical command layer (e.g., Godstone, Wakefield, South Mimms). Operational staff here often bypass NTOC protocols during severe congestion, creating data visibility gaps in the national view. They rely heavily on legacy CCTV and voice comms over digital feeds.
  • HM Treasury (HMT): The ultimate gatekeeper. Controls funding via the Green Book business case process. Their focus on BCR (Benefit-Cost Ratio) often strips out 'gold-plated' operational resilience features (like extra fibre ducting) from initial capital schemes, increasing OpEx later.
The ultimate arbiter of the RIS settlement.
While DfT is our sponsoring department, HMT's 'Green Book' rules and the Spending Review cycle dictate the hard constraints of the Statement of Funds Available (SoFA).
They intervene directly on NSIPs exceeding delegated authority limits (e.g., Lower Thames Crossing).
  • Traffic Officer Service (TOS): Frontline operational staff deploying from outstations. Their welfare facilities and shift-pattern requirements dictate the functional layout of Regional Control Centres and maintenance compounds. High attrition rates linked to poor facility conditions in legacy depots.
The 'boots on the ground' (and in the control room).
They deal with the reality of 'Technology Failure'.
When NTOC systems glitch or SVD throws false positives, the TOS deals with the angry public.
They are skeptical of new 'Digital' initiatives because they bear the operational load when the tech stack fails.
The uniformed operational workforce patrolling the SRN and manning Regional Control Centres (RCCs).
They are the primary consumer of safety-critical L&D and specialized rostering services.
The frontline operational workforce (approx.
1,800 FTE) patrolling the SRN and manning RCCs (e.g., Godstone, Quinton).
This group represents the highest risk exposure for sickness absence due to PTSD from traumatic incident attendance and shift-work fatigue, directly impacting the 'Availability' KPI monitored by the ORR.
On-road operational staff responsible for incident clearance and rolling road blocks.
Operations are heavily impacted by the pause on new Smart Motorways and the retrofit of Emergency Areas (EAs).
National Highways operational staff (On-Road Traffic Officers) empowered under the Traffic Management Act 2004 to stop traffic, close roads, and manage traffic flow.
They operate high-visibility Traffic Officer Vehicles (TOVs) and utilize Airwave radios for coordination with Regional Control Centres (RCCs).
On-road uniformed officers with powers under the Traffic Management Act 2004 to stop traffic, close lanes, and manage incident scenes.
They are critical for the 'Act' and 'Re-open' phases of the CLEAR initiative.
  • Regional Control Centre (RCC) West Midlands: Operational nerve centre at Quinton, managing the M6 Smart Motorway (J13-15). Operates under extreme pressure handling Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) alerts while managing legacy HART system constraints. Frequently in conflict with Asset Delivery teams over access windows for emergency repairs.
Operational hub responsible for M6 J13-15 Smart Motorway active traffic management.
Operators here face cognitive overload from 'phantom' SVD alerts generated by radar interference, creating a tension between rapid Red X activation and verifying genuine incidents to avoid unnecessary congestion.
Operational frontline managing the M6/M5/M42 box.
Operations Managers here trade off 'LARS' (Lane Availability) targets against Traffic Officer safety, frequently ignoring central directives to clear lanes faster if 'Red X' compliance is low.
Operational hub (e.g., Quinton) managing the busiest smart motorway sections (M6 J4-10a).
The reality on the desk: Operators toggling between legacy HALOGEN/COMMAND systems and new CCTV streams, mentally bridging the gap between 'System says clear' and 'Camera shows debris'.
  • National Highways: The government-owned company charged with operating, maintaining, and improving the Strategic Road Network (SRN) under the license from the Secretary of State for Transport; currently navigating the transition from RIS2 to RIS3 amidst significant inflationary pressures and the pause on new Smart Motorways.
  • Coroner's Office: External judicial office that issues Regulation 28 Reports (Prevention of Future Deaths). These carry statutory weight and force NH to formally document lessons learned from fatal incidents on the SRN.
  • Safety, Engineering & Standards (SES): The primary Second Line actor. Custodians of the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB). They authorize departures from standards (CD 123, GG 104) but often struggle to enforce retroactive compliance on legacy assets (e.g., old concrete barriers).
The technical authority and custodian of the DMRB.
Ideally the 'policeman' of safety, but lacks direct budgetary control to enforce standards when Major Projects faces cost overruns.
Issues 'Departures from Standards' which are often rubber-stamped under delivery pressure.
The National Highways technical authority division responsible for owning the DMRB, setting safety standards, and acting as the ultimate technical arbiter for safety departures (The Chief Highway Engineer).
  • DfT Major Projects Sponsor (Tier 1): The ultimate client representative holding the purse strings for RIS2/RIS3 enhancements. Unlike the friendly org chart view, this role holds the 'Intervention Trigger' authority. They control the release of funding against the Statement of Funds Available (SoFA) and rigorously police the Client Scheme Requirements (CSR). They are currently scrutinising the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine scheme due to inflationary pressures challenging the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR).
  • SES (Safety, Engineering and Standards) Climate Team: The technical authority responsible for updating DMRB standards (e.g., GG 103) to reflect climate projections. Often in conflict with Major Projects directorate who view evolving standards as scope creep and cost drivers for schemes like Lower Thames Crossing.
  • 6468da3e-bc13-4830-8a77-8fdc0339c488: Responsible for delivery of the Complex Infrastructure Programme (CIP) and Regional Investment Programme (RIP). Currently under extreme pressure to deliver the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine and A428 Black Cat schemes amidst hyper-inflation that is eroding the RIS2 capital baseline. Operates in a silo from Operations, often delivering assets that are 'compliant' but operationally expensive to maintain.
  • Major Projects Directorate (RIP/CIP): The delivery arm split into Regional Investment Programme (RIP) and Complex Infrastructure Programme (CIP). Focused on hitting RIS2/RIS3 milestones (Start of Works, Open for Traffic). They often view Commercial's governance as a bottleneck when dealing with site realities like unexpected utility diversions or aggressive DCO requirements for schemes like the Lower Thames Crossing.
  • Tier 1 Delivery Partners (RDP Integration): Strategic supply chain partners (e.g., Balfour Beatty, Skanska, Costain) operating under the RDP framework. They sit in the uncomfortable middle, squeezed by NH Commercial's efficiency targets and the inflating costs of materials and sub-contractors. Responsible for delivering schemes like A428 Black Cat and A303 Stonehenge.
  • Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA): Cabinet Office watchdog for the Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP). They conduct the 'Red Team' reviews. They don't just advise; they assign Delivery Confidence Assessments (Red/Amber/Green) that can pause a scheme like the Lower Thames Crossing regardless of National Highways' internal readiness. Their focus is strictly on constructability and Treasury Green Book compliance.
Cabinet Office assurance body.
Currently creating friction by demanding 'Gateway Review 3' (Investment Decision) readiness for the A428 Black Cat scheme, focusing on financial realism despite the volatile inflation affecting the £1.4bn budget.
  • RCC Godstone (M25 Sector): High-pressure Regional Control Centre managing the critical M25 south-east quadrant. Operates on the bleeding edge of capacity; frequently forced to override standard operating procedures (SOPs) to manage non-standard traffic loads. Heavy reliance on manual intervention when automated signaling algorithms (MIDAS/HART) fail to interpret complex congestion patterns near Heathrow/Gatwick.
  • Department for Transport (DfT): Sole shareholder and funding authority. Dictates the decarbonisation pace via RIS mandates. Creates the 'perverse incentive' where capital for road building (RIS2) conflicts with carbon reduction targets.
The shareholder and principal funding authority.
They hold the purse strings for the RIS2/RIS3 investment periods but often lack visibility of the operational sweating of assets required to meet their efficiency targets.
The government department responsible for the English transport network.
As the sole shareholder of National Highways, the DfT sets the Road Investment Strategy (RIS2/RIS3) and holds the company to account for delivery of the Strategic Road Network (SRN).

Implied endpoint for AssociationRelationship to Department for Transport (DfT)
  • Tier 1 Major Projects Supply Chain: Delivery partners for RIS2/RIS3 schemes (e.g., Balfour Beatty, Costain, Skanska working on A66 or A303 Stonehenge). They are contractually obliged to report into HART. There is operational tension here: these actors maintain their own internal EHS systems (e.g., EcoOnline, Sphera), leading to data quality degradation when transposing data into NH's HART system manually.

  • RCC Operator: Operational staff responsible for the 'human-in-the-loop' verification of automated alerts. Validates SVD alerts (filtering false positives from rain/vegetation) and initiates signal setting under TSRGD regulations.
  • Major Projects Directorate - Complex Infrastructure Programme (CIP): Delivery unit responsible for Tier 1 schemes (e.g., A428 Black Cat, A303 Stonehenge). Operates via the Regional Delivery Partnership (RDP) and Delivery Integration Partners (DIPs), managing high-risk DCO processes.
  • Strategic Road Network User: Users of the 4,300 miles of motorways and major A-roads managed by National Highways. Includes freight logistics operators, business commuters, and private travellers who rely on Journey Time Reliability and safety (p50 metrics).
  • National Vehicle Recovery Manager (NVRM): The managed service provider (currently FMG Support) responsible for the statutory removal of broken-down or abandoned vehicles under the National Vehicle Recovery Manager contract to restore carriageway capacity.
  • National Highways Traffic Officer (NHTO): On-road uniformed officers with statutory powers under the Traffic Management Act 2004 to stop traffic, close lanes, and manage incident scenes, operating from Traffic Officer Vehicles (TOVs).
  • Regional Operations Centre (ROC): The control room hub (e.g., Godstone, South Mimms) that coordinates incident response and dispatches Traffic Officers and maintenance crews.
7 regional control rooms (Godstone, South Mimms, etc.) executing tactical traffic management.
Friction point: Inconsistent operating procedures between regions despite national standardisation attempts via command and control systems.
The operational hubs (e.g., Godstone, South Mimms, Wakefield) responsible for controlling signals and dispatching resources within specific SRN regions.
  • Maintenance Service Provider (MSP): Supply chain partners (e.g., Amey, Balfour Beatty, Atkins) contracted via Asset Delivery (AD) or Maintenance & Response (M&R) contracts to execute works.
  • Delivery Integration Partner (DIP): Strategic supply chain partners appointed under the Regional Delivery Partnership (RDP) framework. These actors are responsible for the design and construction of schemes, incentivized on performance metrics regarding safety, customer experience, and delivery efficiency.
  • Regional Operations Centre (ROC) Operator: Operational staff located in RCCs (e.g., Godstone, Wakefield) responsible for signal setting, incident logging, and radio dispatch of Traffic Officers.

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSCOLLABORATION (19 components):
----------------------------------------------
  • Remuneration Committee: Determines Executive pay and bonus structures based on corporate KPIs (Safety, Customer Service, Delivery). A point of contention is how to weigh 'Network Availability' (P50 metrics) against 'Safety Performance' when operational decisions (like closing lanes for ERA retrofit) hurt availability scores.
  • Nominations Committee: Ensures the Board has the right mix of skills (engineering, digital, finance). Currently struggling to find sufficient digital expertise to oversee the massive 'Digital Roads' transformation and the shift from roadside technology to in-vehicle connectivity (V2X).
  • Investment Decision Committee (IDC): The primary battlefield for internal resource allocation. Chaired by the CEO/CFO; mediates the fierce tension between Major Projects (RIS delivery) and Operations (Asset Delivery). Often favours 'ribbon-cutting' capital schemes over unglamorous maintenance, leading to an asset renewal backlog.
  • Departures from Standards Board: The governance forum where technical safety requirements (SES) clash with delivery reality (MP). This is the 'shadow architecture' where GG 104 safety risk assessments are traded off against schedule delays. The source of significant technical debt on the SRN.
  • Audit and Risk Assurance Committee (ARAC): The 'teeth' of the Board. Chaired by a Non-Executive Director (NED). They review the 'Lines of Defence' assurance model. Currently heavily focused on the cyber risks of the transition from legacy NTIS to the cloud-native HART system, and the financial forecasting accuracy of major schemes like the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine project.
  • Safety Committee: Chaired by a NED with safety expertise. They monitor the 'Home Safe and Well' strategy. Operational friction exists here: they demand rigorous adherence to GG 104 (Safety Risk Assessment) for All Lane Running (ALR) schemes, which often clashes with the Major Projects delivery schedules. They review the efficacy of Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) performance in RCCs.
  • Investment Committee: Delegated authority to approve capital expenditure between £100m and £500m (above this goes to DfT/Treasury). They control the SGAR (Stage Gate Assessment Review) outcomes. They are the ones who decide if the A428 Black Cat scheme proceeds to construction or gets held back due to budget constraints.
  • National Severe Weather Cell (Gold Command): Ad-hoc strategic decision body activated during Amber/Red warnings. Comprises Incident Management leads from NTOC, Regional Directors, and Supply Chain representatives. Tension exists here between keeping the Strategic Road Network (SRN) open (RIS KPI requirement) and safety closure mandates (GG 104 safety risk).
  • Complex Infrastructure Programme (CIP) Team: Cross-functional team handling high-risk schemes (A303, LTC). Bridges the gap between MPD delivery focus and General Counsel's risk aversion regarding DCO wording.
Cross-functional team managing Tier 1 schemes (A428, A66, LTC).
Heavily siloed from Operations, leading to 'throw it over the wall' handover issues where maintenance requirements for new assets (e.g., complex tunnel ventilation) are not fully costed in OPEX models.
  • CEDR Transnational Research Programme: Formal mechanism where NH pools resources with peers (Denmark, Netherlands, Germany) to research C-ITS (Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems). This is a strategic workaround to conduct innovation despite RIS2 Efficiency constraints cutting internal R&D budgets.
  • Smart Motorways Programme (SMP) Alliance: Strategic (Tier 1) collaboration of 6 partners (Fluor, Jacobs, WSP, BMS, etc.) intended to deliver the ALR retrofit programme. Currently pivoting to 'safety retrofit' only following the government pause on new ALR schemes. Operates under a shared risk/reward model that is currently strained by scope volatility.
  • Regional Delivery Partnership (RDP) Supply Chain: The coalition of Tier 1 contractors (e.g., Balfour Beatty, Costain, Skanska) who actually deliver the work. They are squeezed between low-margin delivery pressures and the administrative burden of reporting TOMs data to National Highways.
  • Regional Control Centres (RCCs): Operational hubs (e.g., Godstone, Newton-le-Willows) executing tactical traffic management. Friction: Operators often mistrust automated algorithms from CHARM/NTIS, overriding them manually based on local CCTV observations.
  • Regional Delivery Partnership (RDP) Integration Team: The Tier 1 delivery vehicle for RIS2 schemes like the A428 and A66. Supposed to integrate design and build, but often suffers from 'throw it over the wall' behavior between early design (pre-DCO) and construction delivery. Heavily reliant on Tier 2 supply chains for actual plant/labour.
The delivery vehicle for schemes <£500m.
It forces collaboration between designers and contractors (e.g., Costain/Jacobs).
The friction point is the handover of data - the BIM models produced here rarely map cleanly into the NH asset management systems (IAM IS).
  • National Highways Data Science & AI Lab: Collaboration with supply chain partners to bridge the internal skills gap. Focuses on automating the analysis of SCANNER and TRACS pavement data to predict pothole formation (P50 metrics). Currently hindered by legacy data governance issues within the ADDS (Asset Data Definitions Structure).
  • Investment Programme Committee (IPC): The critical gatekeeper forum for capital approvals; often creates a bottleneck where operational urgencies clash with rigid 5-year RIS funding cycles and governance papers required for DfT investment decisions.
  • A428 Black Cat to Caxton Gibbet Delivery Team: Joint venture delivery team (Skanska/National Highways) executing the £1bn+ RIS2 scheme. Currently managing acute tension between aggressive construction milestones and the requirement to validate digital asset data (ADMM Part 2) prior to handover.
  • ORR (Office of Rail and Road) Holding to Account: The regulator enforcing RIS2/RIS3 efficiency and safety. They are sceptical of 'shiny' future mobility projects (MaaS/AMoD) if basic asset condition (skid resistance, drainage) deteriorates. This creates a governance tension where innovation funding is often raided to plug maintenance budget holes.
  • Smart Motorways Stocktake Taskforce: A specific cross-directorate body formed to address the intense scrutiny on ALR (All Lane Running) schemes. Generated specific lessons that forced retrofitting of Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) technology.

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSEVENT (15 components):
--------------------------------------
  • Stage 0 Strategy (Strategic Outline Case) Review: Gateway review determining strategic alignment with RIS goals. High failure rate for regional schemes that fail to demonstrate BCR (Benefit-Cost Ratio) > 1.5 early on. Independent reviewers look for alignment with the Road to Net Zero strategy.
  • Stage 2 Option Selection (Outline Business Case) Review: Critical gateway where the 'Preferred Route Announcement' (PRA) is authorised. Historically a bottleneck where environmental constraints (biodiversity net gain) clash with engineering feasibility. Requires sign-off from the Chief Analyst regarding traffic modelling data.
  • Stage 3 Preliminary Design (Full Business Case) Review: The 'Point of No Return' investment decision. Requires a matured GG 104 safety file and locked target price. This is where the tension between the Supply Chain's inflation costs and the fixed RIS budget envelope is most acute.
  • Smart Motorway Evidence Stocktake (2020/2022): The pivotal regulatory event that fundamentally altered TOS operations. It mandated the retrofitting of additional Emergency Areas (ERAs) and forced the acceleration of Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD). This event shifted the TOS focus from 'traffic flow' to 'live lane safety' almost exclusively.
  • Met Office National Severe Weather Warning (Amber/Red): External trigger event indicating high impact weather. Specific thresholds: Snow >5cm accumulation, Mean wind speeds >50mph (High Sided Vehicles) or >60mph (All traffic). Triggers automatic escalation to National Crisis Management Command structures.
  • Value Management (VM) Workshop: The operational 'battleground' where Asset Needs (what the data says) meets Commercial Reality (budget availability). Schemes are cut, deferred, or descoped here. Often results in 'holding treatments' (patching) being selected over necessary deep renewals, kicking the can down the road to RIS4.
  • Aquaplaning Risk Event: The safety realization of drainage failure. Triggers immediate control centre (RCC) intervention (speed limits, lane closures) and subsequent GG 104 safety risk assessments. The primary driver for priority renewals.
  • DCO Application Acceptance: The critical gate where PINS has 28 days to decide if the application (and the consultation behind it) meets standards. If this fails (as seen in early A303 attempts), the scheme is set back by months/years. This is the hard deadline driving the 'Consultation Report' production.
  • Clause 60.1 Compensation Event (Ground Conditions): The 'Unforeseen Physical Conditions' claim. Contractors on the A428 and A303 are leveraging this to claim time and money for soil toxicity or water table issues that 'an experienced contractor could not have foreseen', straining the contingency budget.
  • Red X Non-Compliance: A specific behavioural failure where drivers ignore lane closures. This is a proxy for the 'Behavioral' aspect of CAV acceptance. If users won't obey simple distinct signals (TSRGD mandated), the complex handover protocols required for Level 3/4 autonomy are operationally terrifying.
  • VRS Strike M6 J14: Specific trigger event: Heavy Goods Vehicle impacts concrete step barrier. Immediate operational crisis that triggers the friction between traffic flow restoration duties and asset integrity standards.
  • Unplanned Stationary Vehicle Incident (SVD): Detection of a stopped vehicle in a live lane on ALR (All Lane Running) sections (e.g., M1 J13-16, M25 J23-27). Critical input for the Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake commitments. Triggers immediate safety protocol activation under GG 104 constraints.
  • Pavement Surface Failure (Heat Buckling): Specific incident type occurring during temperature extremes (>35°C), primarily affecting concrete bay sections (A14, M11). Requires immediate emergency traffic management (ETM) and unplanned surfacing interventions, impacting Network Availability (P50) metrics.
  • M1 J34 Operational Failure Incident: Representative of legacy ALR failures where a stopped vehicle was not detected by MIDAS, and CCTV coverage was obscured. Highlighted the gap between 'theoretical availability' of technology and actual operational detection capability.
  • IPV Strike / Incursion Event: A specific high-risk operational event where a live lane vehicle impacts a traffic management vehicle. Mandatory recording in HART. These events trigger immediate 'Safety Alert' workflows to the wider community.

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSFUNCTION (33 components):
-----------------------------------------
  • Network Operations & Maintenance (Revenue Funded): The operational reality funded by a constrained ~£2bn annual revenue budget. Responsible for winter service, Traffic Officer response, and reactive repairs. Heavily reliant on the Asset Delivery model, currently struggling with inflation eroding purchasing power for basic materials like salt and bitumen.
  • SES Technical Authority & Assurance: The 'Governance Gatekeeper' within Safety, Engineering and Standards (SES). Responsible for owning the DMRB (Design Manual for Roads and Bridges). Currently struggling to update rigid standards (like GG 104) fast enough to accommodate agile digital innovations, creating a 'pace layering' mismatch with the Digital Roads strategy.
  • Major Infrastructure Delivery Procurement (RDP & DIP): Manages the Regional Delivery Partnership (RDP) and Delivery Integration Partners (DIP) frameworks. This function is currently strained by the hyper-inflation impact on RIS2/RIS3 baseline budgets, specifically for the A428 Black Cat and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine schemes. Accountability for design risk transfer under NEC4 Target Cost contracts remains a significant point of friction.
  • Operations & Maintenance Procurement (Asset Delivery): Responsible for procuring the supply chain that keeps the network running: winter services, pavement renewals, and vegetation management. The shift from Asset Support Contracts (ASC) to the in-house Asset Delivery (AD) model has shifted risk back to NH, exposing gaps in our internal capability to act as the 'intelligent client' for scheduling work packages.
  • Technology and Telecoms Procurement (NRTS & OT): Manages the National Roads Telecommunications Services (NRTS2) and operational technology purchasing. This is where legacy meets ambition; we are trying to buy 'Digital Roads' capability (V2X, Edge Computing) while still paying to maintain 20-year-old copper networks and aging MIDAS loops that are failing due to pavement degradation.
  • Professional Services Procurement (SPaTS 2): Manages the Specialist Professional and Technical Services (SPaTS 2) framework. This is how we buy brains—modelling, environmental consultancy, and legal advice for DCO applications. There is a perverse incentive here: consultants are paid by time, while NH seeks outcome-based speed, particularly for DCO approvals which are lagging.
  • Safety, Health and Wellbeing (SHW) Division: The central governance body attempting to standardize occupational health across the Strategic Road Network (SRN). Currently managing the tension between the 'Home Safe and Well' strategy and the intense delivery pressures of RIS2 close-out on schemes like the A428 Black Cat.
  • Commercial and Procurement (C&P) Assurance: The 'Second Line of Defence' responsible for verifying 'Defined Cost' across the RIS2 and RIS3 portfolio. This function creates operational friction with Major Projects delivery teams (e.g., A428, A66) by enforcing strict substantiation requirements on monthly Applications for Payment, often delaying cash flow to Tier 1 contractors to ensure Value for Money.
  • Human Resources & Organisational Development: The central function managing the NH workforce, currently under significant pressure to deliver RIS3 capability plans amidst public sector headcount caps. It struggles with the dual mandate of supporting corporate office staff (The Cube, Birmingham) and the operational 24/7 Traffic Officer Service across 7 regions. Heavily reliant on Oracle HCM.
  • General Counsel & Statutory Governance: The centralized legal authority ensuring National Highways operates within the License issued by the DfT. Unlike a standard corporate legal team, this function actively manages the tension between rapid RIS3 delivery and the rigid statutory constraints of the Highways Act 1980 and Planning Act 2008. They are the gatekeepers for Development Consent Orders (DCOs) and hold the ultimate risk ownership for NEC4 contract disputes.
  • NEC4 Contract Governance & Dispute Resolution: The function administering the complex commercial logic of NEC4 ECC contracts. It manages Compensation Events (CEs), Early Warning Notices (EWNs), and Pain/Gain share calculations. A key friction point is the interpretation of 'Disallowed Cost' under the Scheme of Construction Options, particularly regarding substantiation of supply chain defined costs.
  • Major Projects Directorate (MP): The capital delivery arm. They are incentivized to deliver schemes like A66 and Lower Thames Crossing on time/budget (CPI), often value-engineering out technology elements that Operations later desperately needs.
  • Operations Directorate: The revenue-funded arm managing the SRN. They inherit the assets built by MP. They are currently struggling with the 'Do More With Less' efficiency challenge while managing aging structures and the Smart Motorway legacy.

  • Ensures transparent reporting and accountability: Provides budget control and regulatory reporting
  • Sets strategic direction and performance expectations: Provides organisational governance and strategic oversight
  • Safety, Engineering and Standards (SES): The National Highways technical authority function responsible for setting DMRB standards, acting as the Technical Approval Authority (TAA), and ensuring the long-term safety and integrity of the SRN.
  • Structures Technical Authority (TAA): Specialized sub-function within SES or delegated regional engineering teams responsible for 'Technical Approval of Highway Structures' in accordance with DMRB CG 300.
  • Asset Management Operations: The core operational function responsible for the strategic planning, condition monitoring, and lifecycle engineering of physical assets (pavements, structures, technology) on the SRN.

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSINTERACTION (5 components):
--------------------------------------------
  • Tactical Diversion Route Activation (Solid Black Shape): Re-routing SRN traffic onto Local Highway Authority (LHA) roads. Friction point: LHAs often resist activation due to lack of funding for resulting road degradation. Legacy issue: Some routes still require physical 'flap' sign turning by contractors.
  • Collaborative Performance Framework (CPF) Assessment: The monthly ritual where NH scores suppliers. In reality, scores are often inflated by delivery teams to maintain relationships, masking underlying performance issues until they become critical failures (e.g., delayed concrete testing data).
  • Transport Select Committee (TSC) Evidence Session: The high-stakes interaction where NH Executive Directors are held accountable by MPs. Requires extensive preparation by Public Affairs to explain variances in RIS2 delivery, specifically the pause on new All Lane Running (ALR) schemes and the retrofit of Emergency Areas (ERAs) on the M6 and M1. Failure here impacts future RIS3 funding settlements.
  • Commercial Settlement of Defects: The interaction between MP Commercial teams and Tier 1 contractors. Tensions arise when Ops identifies latent defects (skid resistance failure) post-12-month rectification period, forcing Ops to fund repairs from routine maintenance budgets.
  • Quarterly Performance & Risk Review (QPRR): The high-stakes meeting where Directorate risk registers are challenged by the Executive. Often a theater of negotiation where Safety, Engineering and Standards (SES) push for higher risk visibility while Major Projects attempts to downgrade risk ratings to maintain 'Green' delivery status.

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSINTERFACE (2 components):
------------------------------------------
  • Single Point of Failure: National Roads Telecommunications Services (NRTS): The fiber/copper network connecting 30,000 roadside devices to RCCs. If NRTS goes down, the Smart Motorway signals go dark, and the road must be physically closed by Traffic Officers. A massive operational risk.
  • Section 278 Developer Contribution Process: The mechanism for 'Value Capture' where third-party developers fund SRN improvements (e.g., new junctions for logistics parks). Operational reality: A nightmare of conflicting incentives. Developers want minimum viable product for planning consent; NH Architecture requires GG 104 safety compliance and 60-year asset life, leading to prolonged technical approval cycles.

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSOBJECT (89 components):
---------------------------------------
  • RIS2 License: The statutory instrument defining the Secretary of State's directions to NH. It includes legally binding conditions on efficiency (Conditions 5.23) which conflict with the DfT's frequent changes to scope (e.g., pausing the M3 J9 scheme), leaving NH accountable for efficiency targets they cannot operationally control.
  • HM Treasury Green Book (5 Case Model): The mandatory framework for all business cases. Specifically, the 'Economic Case' (BCR) often conflicts with the 'Strategic Case' (Levelling Up). This tension forces creative accounting on schemes like A66 to justify the Value for Money (VfM) when standard transport economics say 'do not build'.
  • Lower Thames Crossing DCO Application: The largest DCO (Development Consent Order) ever undertaken. It consumes vast amounts of SES and Major Projects bandwidth. The architectural trade-off is the sheer cost of the tunnel safety systems (ventilation, fire suppression) vs. the economic benefit model.
The Development Consent Order documentation for the LTC.
Represents a massive accumulation of statutory constraints that will bind Operations for 100 years.
The 'Operational Phase' requirements in the DCO are often drafted by planners, not operators, creating future compliance traps.
The massive Development Consent Order documentation for the LTC.
It has become a 'zombie' architectural object—consuming vast legal and planning resources while trapped in planning purgatory, distorting resource allocation away from smaller, deliverable renewal schemes.
A massive dataset representing the most advanced 'Digital Twin' model we have for a single scheme.
It represents a tension: it is highly detailed but incompatible with the national operational model used by legacy regional control centres.
Massive dataset required for the Development Consent Order.
Contains environmental statements and traffic modelling.
The sheer volume of data creates storage costs and version control issues between the delivery partnership and NH central assurance.
  • Risk Appetite Statement: Defined by the Board to guide operational decisions. Paradoxically, the Board claims a 'low' risk appetite for safety (zero harm), but the legacy infrastructure (concrete roads, unlit sections) requires a 'moderate' operational risk acceptance to keep the network open.
The definitive commercial document closing out a scheme (or RIS period).
For legacy schemes, this is often delayed by years due to unresolved Compensation Events and disputes over 'Pain/Gain' share calculations.
  • Strategic Road Network Initial Report (SRNIR): The statutory document National Highways submits to the DfT to kickstart the RIS setting process. It's the primary output of the Route Strategies. It contains the 'unconstrained view' of network needs, heavily redacted to align with political sensitivities regarding Smart Motorways (ALR) and environmental headwinds. Critically, it outlines the funding gap for Renewals (Operations) vs Enhancements.
The formal output of the Route Strategy process.
It constitutes the 'advice' to the Secretary of State for Transport.
While comprehensive, it represents a 'wish list' before the hard constraints of the RIS Settlement are applied.
  • Optimism Bias Adjustment: A mandatory financial calculation applied to scheme estimates during assurance. Often a point of contention; CPMO enforces higher bias percentages (increasing required budget) which scheme Project Managers fight against to keep projects viable within the RIS envelope.
  • Route Strategy Evidence Reports (18 Regional Bundles): The 18 specific documents (e.g., 'London Orbital', 'South Coast') detailing the state of the network. These are often inconsistent in quality depending on the regional OD's engagement level. They contain the specific tension points: e.g., M60 J8-18 congestion vs. lack of land for widening. These feed the national SRNIR.
  • Incident Timeline Data (LARS): The Logging and Reporting System record used for post-incident debriefs. Data Quality Issue: Start times are often fuzzy (detection vs verification), making 'Response Time' analysis for ORR reporting difficult. LARS relies on operator manual entry, which is often deprioritized during major events.
  • Live Lane Breakdown Classification: High-risk incident type on ALR (All Lane Running) schemes. Frequency is increasing alongside vehicle fleet age. Requires immediate Red X compliance. If detection > 60s, risk of secondary collision spikes exponentially (GG 104 safety risk).
  • Electric Vehicle (EV) Fire Classification: Emerging incident type requiring specific operational protocol (quarantine areas, increased exclusion zones). Current recovery contracts often lack sufficient capability for thermal runaway management, causing prolonged lane closures.
  • Statutory Collision Data (STATS19): Formal record of PI (Personal Injury) collisions. There is a data latency gap between Police recording (CRASH system) and National Highways operational data (HALOGEN), obscuring real-time safety hotspot analysis.
  • JESIP Joint Decision Log: The formal record of decisions made between Police (Gold/Silver command) and NH Traffic Officers (Bronze). Inaccuracies here often lead to post-incident liability disputes regarding who authorized the 'All Stop' versus rolling road block, particularly in Smart Motorway Evidence Stocktake reviews.
  • TMA 2004 Delegated Powers: Specific statutory powers granted to ORTOs: Power to stop and direct traffic (Sections 6/7), power to place temporary traffic signs, and authority to close lanes. Crucial distinction: TOs do NOT have Pace powers (speed enforcement) or power of arrest, creating frequent operational friction with Police forces during 'gold command' incident handovers.
  • Development Consent Order (DCO): The statutory instrument required for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs). The 'gold plating' of DCO applications to avoid judicial review is doubling the pre-construction phase duration.
Statutory instrument required for NSIPs (Planning Act 2008).
The primary bottleneck for CIP schemes.
Requires massive environmental data submission and public consultation evidence.
The statutory instrument authorising NSIPs (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects).
For A66 and LTC, the DCO is not just permission; it is a rigidity constraint.
It locks in technology assumptions made 3 years prior, often forcing the delivery of obsolete technology because changing the DCO is too legally risky.
Statutory planning instrument for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP).
The legal document that allows NH to compulsorily purchase land.
The A303 Stonehenge DCO quashing by the High Court set a precedent that now delays all other DCOs (e.g., LTC) due to carbon cumulative impact requirements.
The statutory instrument required for NSIPs (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects).
For LTC, this document is thousands of pages.
Any architectural change to the tunnel design now requires a formal amendment process, effectively freezing innovation.
The legal instrument for NSIPs.
Gaining this for the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine was a bureaucratic war.
It locks in environmental commitments that constrain operational flexibility for decades.
The statutory instrument authorizing NSIPs.
Recent legal challenges (e.g., Transport Action Network) regarding cumulative carbon assessment have forced a rewrite of how we present environmental data for schemes like A428 and A66 to avoid judicial review.
Once granted, it functions as a rigid legal straitjacket.
Any operational change (e.g., moving a gantry 50 meters) requires a non-material change application, causing months of delay.
A major source of architectural rigidity.
The statutory instrument required for NSIPs (LTC, A66).
It freezes the design.
If Operations realizes post-DCO that a maintenance bay is unsafe (GG 104), changing it requires a massive legal amendment process, so often they just accept the risk.
The legal instrument required for NSIPs (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects).
It is not just a permit; it locks in specific environmental mitigations that constrain operational flexibility for decades (e.g., noise limits restricting night-time maintenance on the A14).
For schemes like A66 and LTC, this document freezes the architecture years before delivery, making it hard to retrofit modern digital standards (e.g., V2X) later.
The statutory instrument required for NSIPs.
The legal 'permission to build'.
The process is arduous; the A303 Stonehenge DCO judicial reviews demonstrate how legal challenges can stall architectural roadmaps for years, leaving capital funds unspent and carrying costs high.
It is not just a permit; it is legislation.
It locks in environmental commitments (Requirements) that constrain operational flexibility for decades.
For the A66, the DCO process has exposed data quality issues in land referencing, delaying the start of works.
The statutory instrument that legally binds scheme delivery.
It locks in environmental commitments and land use, often conflicting with later value-engineering attempts.
For LTC and A66, the DCO process dictates the architectural constraints more than any internal strategy.
The statutory instrument required for NSIPs like LTC and A66.
The application process consumes vast legal and environmental resources, often paralyzing decision-making on design changes.
The massive legal tome (often 10,000+ pages for schemes like Lower Thames Crossing) that creates binding 'Requirements'.
It is not just data; it is a liability register.
Operations must live with these commitments (e.g., noise barriers, bat bridges) for 60 years.
The legal planning instrument for the LTC.
The sheer volume of environmental data and consultation responses required has made this the most complex DCO in UK history, draining resource from other strategic planning activities and highlighting the fragility of the NSIP (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects) process.
The statutory planning instrument.
The primary source of schedule slip in the capital programme.
Requires immense data production (Environmental Statements) that are rarely reused for operational baselining.
The statutory instrument granting planning permission for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects, essential for schemes like the A428 and A66.
  • Condition Data Set (TRACS/SCRIM): Raw condition data including skid resistance (SCRIM) and ride quality. This data is often siloed before ingestion into HASS, creating a 'swivel chair' integration problem where engineers manually validate anomalies against video footage.
  • National Skid Resistance Survey (SCRIM) Data: distinct dataset from SCANNER, measuring wet-road skid resistance. Highly sensitive data due to legal implications in collision investigations. Failure to process this data within 48 hours of survey creates massive corporate liability exposure under the Highways Act 1980.
  • SRN Pavement Condition Data (SCANNER/TRACS): The raw machine-surveyed data covering rutting, ride quality (longitudinal profile), and texture depth. Collected annually via high-speed survey vehicles. Operational Constraint: There is a 3-6 month lag between data collection and availability in HAPMS/IAM-IS, meaning investment decisions for Year 1 of a delivery cycle are often based on data that is 18 months old, risking scope creep when contractors mobilize.
  • Performance Specification (P50): The primary metric for average delay. Creates a perverse incentive for Regional Directors to delay booking maintenance access (road space booking) to keep lanes open, resulting in a backlog of Category 2 defects and deteriorating Asset Condition (LARS) scores.
  • As-Built Asset Attribute Data: The specific data payload required at handover. Includes safety-critical attributes: Barrier Performance Class (H1/H2), Pavement Material Type (Thin Surface Course vs. Hot Rolled Asphalt), and ITS device IP configurations. Missing attributes here directly impact LARS (Long-term Asset Renewal Strategy) modeling.
  • Bridge Condition Index (BCI) Score: The aggregated metric (0-100) derived from element-level severity and extent scores (CS 450). Critical distinction: BCI_avg (network health) vs. BCI_crit (safety critical elements). A high BCI_avg can hide a failing pier crosshead. Used to justify capital renewal funding in the Road Investment Strategy (RIS).
  • RIS2 Capital Renewals Budget: The ring-fenced funding pot for 2020-2025. Inflation has eroded the real purchasing power, forcing the Deferral of lower-priority schemes (e.g., A14 drainage) to fund overspending on critical structures like the M5 Oldbury Viaduct.
  • Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) Data: Real-time alerts generated by radar units on ALR sections. Feeds into NTOC (National Traffic Operations Centre) but suffers from high false alarm rates, causing operator fatigue and reducing trust in the system.
Critical operational data stream derived from radar units on Smart Motorways (ALR).
The signal-to-noise ratio (false alarms) is the primary operational headache, affecting Traffic Officer trust and Control Room workload.
Accuracy is a key ORR compliance metric.
  • Environmental Statement (ES): Legal document detailing impacts. strictly governed by DMRB LA 101-120 standards. Inconsistencies here (e.g., between traffic modeling in the Transport Assessment and noise modeling in the ES) are primary attack vectors during Examination.
The legal document detailing the assessment of environmental impacts for an NSIP.
Includes chapters on Noise, Air Quality, Biodiversity, and Landscape.
Reviewed by the Planning Inspectorate.
  • Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC): A legally binding document defining how NH will consult with the local community. Must be developed in collaboration with Host Local Authorities. If the SoCC is deemed inadequate by Local Authorities, the entire DCO application is at risk of rejection by the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) at the acceptance stage.
  • Consultation Report: The massive evidentiary document (often 1000+ pages) submitted to PINS demonstrating how NH regarded responses under s49 of the Planning Act 2008. This is the primary audit trail defending against accusations of 'predetermination'. It links specific feedback to design changes or justifications for rejection.
  • Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR): Snapshot of the Environmental Statement shared during consultation. A major source of tension: stakeholders treat it as a final design and attack it, while NH engineers view it as a 'worst-case scenario' envelope. Misalignment here drives negative sentiment scores.
  • Traffic Flow Data (MIDAS/TMU): Raw loop data and radar data from MIDAS and Traffic Monitoring Units. Used to calculate 'Delay' and 'Reliability' metrics. Critical tension: Aging inductive loops on the SRN are failing at a rate faster than renewals, leading to data gaps in the Route Strategy evidence base, forcing reliance on third-party floating vehicle data.
  • Carbon Tool v2.5: The mandatory reporting mechanism for supply chain partners. Technically legacy; it's a glorified spreadsheet wrapper that fails to integrate via API with modern BIM (Building Information Modelling) or digital twin platforms. This lack of integration forces manual double-handling of data by contractors, leading to 'reporting fatigue' and data lags of up to a quarter.
Mandatory reporting tool for supply chain to log embodied carbon.
Links to ADMM (Asset Data Management Manual).
Often criticized for data lag; contractors 'game' the inputs to meet KPIs rather than genuinely reducing carbon.
  • Asset Data (ADMM Format): Asset Data Management Manual formatted data. The currency of handover. Innovation trials often produce rich, unstructured data (LiDAR point clouds, video analytics) which gets stripped down to basic ADMM attributes to fit into the legacy HAPMS/IAM IS databases, destroying value.
  • Vehicle Special Order (VSO): The bureaucratic instrument used by the DfT/VCA to legally permit the trials. It serves as a temporary suspension of specific construction and use regulations. This creates a fragmented enforcement environment for NH Traffic Officers, who must distinguish between a 'legal' trial VSO scooter and an 'illegal' private scooter on the Strategic Road Network, often with no visual distinction at 60mph.
  • Departure from Standards (DAS): The formal record authorizing non-compliance with DMRB (e.g., CD 377 for barriers or CD 529 for drainage). Used by Major Projects to legitimize value engineering decisions, effectively codifying the transfer of risk to Operations.
  • Strategic Supply Chain Risk Register: The 'dirty laundry' list of single-source dependencies. Includes specific risks like the monopoly on Dynac/CHARM traffic management software (Kapsch) and the scarcity of specialized tunneling labor for the Lower Thames Crossing. It is rarely fully transparent to the DfT due to political sensitivity.
  • Project Bank Accounts (PBA) Mechanism: Financial instrument mandated to protect Tier 2/3 subcontractors from Tier 1 insolvency. While policy dictates their use, Tier 1 contractors frequently resist or delay implementation to maintain their own working capital flows, creating hidden friction in the supply chain.
The financial mechanism ensuring Tier 2/3 suppliers get paid.
Commercial monitors this strictly to prevent Tier 1s from holding cash, but setting these up for complex JVs (like on A66) is an administrative burden that slows down mobilization.
  • Application for Payment (AfP): The monthly data submission from the Tier 1 contractor detailing costs incurred. Must be substantiated by timesheets, invoices, and Goods Received Notes. Inaccurate AfPs are the primary trigger for commercial reject notices.
  • Hazard Log (GDMS/SharePoint): The live repository of identified risks for specific schemes. Often fragmented across disparate systems (legacy spreadsheets vs. new GDMS instances), leading to poor visibility of systemic risks across the SRN.
  • STATS19 Collision Data: Standardised police collision reporting data used as the primary input for cluster identification. A critical operational constraint is the lag time (often 6-12 months) between incident occurrence and validated data availability in NH systems, forcing architects to rely on raw control centre logs (HALOGEN) for immediate post-incident analysis despite lower data quality.
Standardised accident reporting dataset provided by the Police.
The lag in validation (often 6-12 months) creates a 'knowledge blind spot' for immediate operational trend analysis.
Standardized dataset of personal injury road accidents, supplied by police forces (via CRASH/COPA) and critical for calculating Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) metrics.
  • Health and Safety File (H&S File): The repository of residual risk data (e.g., hazardous materials, maintenance access limitations) required for future operations. This is the 'hot potato' of the PCF Stage 6 Handover; if not digitized correctly for ingestion into HART/IAM IS, it becomes 'dead data' in a PDF, creating latent safety risks for Traffic Officers and maintenance crews.
  • Protected Species License (Great Crested Newt/Badger): Legal permits from Natural England. These have hard seasonal constraints (e.g., you can't move newts in winter). Missing a window by one week can delay a RIS scheme (like A417 Missing Link) by a full year, wrecking the P50 delivery confidence.
  • Carbon Tool (Carbon Calculation Platform): The mandated calculation engine for estimating scheme carbon. It relies on standard emissions factors that often lag behind material innovation, creating a perverse incentive where contractors use better materials but can't claim the 'carbon credit' in the official score.
  • International Benchmarking Report 2024: A politically sensitive document used to justify RIS3 funding requests to the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). It selectively compares NH performance (P50 Network Availability) against international peers to demonstrate efficiency, often glossing over the structural differences in network age and legacy debt.
  • Development Consent Order (DCO) Requirements: The legal constraints for NSIPs (A66, A428, LTC). These contain 'hard' commitments to stakeholders that the supply chain must deliver. Often, the supply chain prices the works before fully understanding the DCO environmental constraints, leading to cost shocks later.
Legal planning instruments for NSIPs (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects).
We are currently retrofitting digital connectivity requirements into the DCOs for the Lower Thames Crossing and A66 to ensure we don't build 'dumb' concrete that needs digging up in 5 years for fibre.
  • Social Value Delivery Plan (Contractual): The binding document within the NEC4 contract. It details specific commitments to TOMs measures. A critical friction point: contractors often 'gold plate' this at bid stage (to win the 10% score) but struggle to deliver practically once site mobilization begins.
  • Pavement Condition Data (SCANNER/LARS): The raw physics of the road. Laser surface operational data measuring rutting, texture, and cracking. Crucial for determining the 'Road Surface Condition' (RSC) KPI. Discrepancies between this data and actual driver experience (potholes) create significant reputational risk.
  • Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) Radar Telemetry: High-velocity data stream from radar units on ALR sections (e.g., M6 J13-15). The signal-to-noise ratio is a major architectural problem; false positives from rain or vegetation trigger alarms in RCCs, desensitizing operators and risking missed genuine incidents.
  • Development Consent Order (DCO) Application Data: Massive datasets (thousands of PDFs, geospatial maps, environmental statements) for NSIPs like Lower Thames Crossing. The digital presentation of this object determines the validity of the statutory consultation process under the Planning Act 2008.
Massive legal documentation sets for NSIPs like the A66.
Stored in ProjectWise; strictly version-controlled to avoid judicial review risks.
The massive legal instrument (often 50,000+ pages) comprising the Draft DCO, Environmental Statement, Book of Reference, and Consultation Report.
Must comply with APFP Regulations.
The legal instrument for NSIPs.
Becoming increasingly difficult to secure due to environmental challenges, causing planning blight and freezing capital that should be deployed.
Recent legal challenges (climate change grounds on A303 Stonehenge) have forced Architecture to heavily document carbon baselines in PAS 2080, adding months to the pre-construction phase.
  • Tunnel Safety File (TSF): The mandatory living documentation for a specific tunnel (e.g., A3 Hindhead). It aggregates the 'as-built' drawings, the Operation and Maintenance Manuals (O&M), and the Emergency Response Plans. Operational reality: often fragmented across SharePoint and legacy drives, making real-time access during a live incident at the RCC difficult, despite being a regulatory requirement.
  • Network Availability Metric (P50): Key RIS2/RIS3 performance indicator. Tunnel closures heavily penalise this metric, creating a perverse incentive for operators to keep lanes open for 'recovery' rather than immediate closure during ambiguous incidents.
Key Performance Indicator for RIS2.
Measures the percentage of the network available to traffic.
BCP events (flooding, IT outage) directly degrade this score, impacting ORR regulatory grading.
  • Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) Data: Real-time traffic signal state data generated by traffic controllers. Critical for GLOSA (Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory). Latency requirement is <100ms. Current legacy backhaul via HALOGEN often introduces latency exceeding safety thresholds for autonomous intersection entry.
  • 5.9GHz Spectrum Allocation: The scarce resource (5.875-5.905 GHz). Ofcom manages this. The operational tension is interference management between ITS-G5 and C-V2X if not strictly time-multiplexed or frequency separated. A major risk for safety-critical messages (DENM/CAM).
  • Floating Vehicle Data (FVD): Anonymized trajectory and speed data harvested from connected commercial fleets. Architecturally competes with legacy inductive loops (MIDAS) as the truth source for 'Network Availability' metrics. Integration into NTIS is currently hampered by commercial data licensing disputes.
  • COBie Data Drop 4 (Handover): Construction Operations Building information exchange. The specific spreadsheet-based XML schema required at 'Gate 6' (Handover). It is meant to be the 'Golden Thread', but often arrives as a massive, disjointed dataset that the Asset Information Group struggles to validate against physical reality before the contractor demobilizes.
  • RIS3 Resource Baseline: The data set defining the required FTE and competency mix to deliver the 3rd Road Investment Strategy. Currently shows a significant gap in Digital Roads capability.
  • Traffic Officer Competency Record: Safety-critical record detailing a Traffic Officer's authority to manage live traffic, use police powers (stop/direct), and operate specific vehicle equipment. Must be audit-ready for ORR inspections.
  • ORR Efficiency & Performance Report: The statutory report submitted to the Office of Rail and Road. It aggregates workforce efficiency metrics. If we miss efficiency targets here, it impacts the funding settlement for the next Road Period (RIS3), creating pressure to suppress headcount growth regardless of operational demand.
  • Lower Thames Crossing Judicial Review Risk Register: A highly sensitive, privilege-protected artifact tracking potential legal challenges regarding air quality (DMRB LA 105), carbon impact, and habitat regulation assessments. This object dictates the 'defensive design' decisions that often inflate scheme costs to ensure legal robustness against environmental NGOs.
  • Section 278 Agreement: Legal contracts allowing third-party developers to alter the SRN. These are a bottleneck for economic growth around junctions. The friction arises when developer timelines clash with the technical approval cycle (TAS) required by NH engineering standards (CD 122).
  • Ministerial Correspondence ('Red' Cases): High-priority inquiries from MPs and Ministers that bypass standard SLAs. These often concern noise mitigation (e.g., A34 Botley) or air quality management areas (AQMA). The handling of these cases creates significant disruptive flow in regional engineering teams who must divert resources from delivery to draft technical responses within tight DfT deadlines.
  • Corporate Risk Register (CRR): The top-tier artifact tracking existential threats to NH. Currently dominated by 'Financial Solvency' (post-RIS2 overspend), 'Cyber Security' (CNI obligations), and 'Smart Motorway Safety Evidence' (post-stocktake data integrity). Often sanitized before reaching the DfT Board.
  • Limited Assurance Opinion: The classification given by Internal Audit when controls are found to be weak. Recently applied to 'Asset Data Quality' (ADMM compliance), highlighting that we don't fully know the condition of the assets we are trying to maintain.
  • Regional Delivery Partnership (RDP) Contract: The high-value commercial vehicle for delivering RIS2 schemes. It relies on specific incentives for 'Added Value'. The new Category Management process risks stripping out the flexibility required to deliver complex interchanges like M6 J10, creating a conflict between Commercial Directorate and Major Projects Delivery.
  • Spend Data >£25k Publication Schema: Mandatory transparency dataset published monthly. It's often messy because legacy ERP systems (Oracle) categorize costs poorly. Journalists use this to identify consultancy spend trends, specifically targeting 'management consultant' fees vs. 'engineering' spend.
  • ADMM Asset Data Packet: Asset Data Management Manual compliant dataset. Critical friction point: Major Projects often deliver geometry without attribute data, causing 'grey asset' status in IAM IS where maintenance intervals cannot be automated.
  • Smart Motorway Safety Evidence Stocktake Data: The highly sensitive dataset underpinning the 2020 and 2022 stocktakes. Includes Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) stats, Red X compliance rates, and Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) performance. Subject to intense scrutiny by Transport Select Committee and requires rigorous validation against STATS19 police data before release.
The sensitive dataset mandated by the Transport Select Committee.
Contains comparative safety stats (KPI 1: Fatalities/Weighted Injuries) for ALR vs.
Conventional motorways.
This data directly constrains the rollout of new schemes like the M6 J21a-26.
  • National Traffic Information Service (NTIS) Data Feed: The 'Datex II' XML feed pushing network status to sat-nav providers (Google/Waze) and logistics companies. Latency issues here cause a disconnect between in-car navigation and physical Variable Message Signs (VMS), confusing road users.
  • Asset Data Management Manual (ADMM) Data Set: The codified representation of built assets. Historically poor quality at handover (Piling logs missing, drainage data incorrect) leads to immediate operational blind spots and prevents predictive maintenance in the Asset Management System (IAM-IS).
The standard defining how asset data flows from construction (supply chain) to NH operation (NTIS/HART).
Historically the biggest failure point; suppliers deliver the physical road but fail to deliver compliant ADMM data, crippling the Digital Twin ambition.
  • Regulation 28 PFD Report: Prevention of Future Deaths report issued by a Coroner. A critical external driver for knowledge capture that bypasses internal bureaucratic filters. Requires mandatory response within 56 days.
  • POPE Meta-Analysis Report: Aggregated lessons from multiple schemes. Used to update the TAG (Transport Analysis Guidance) and NH internal modelling assumptions, though the feedback loop to new scheme designs (e.g., A66 Northern Trans-Pennine) is often slow.
  • da893460-81f9-4285-a5c5-47c7ac3d4d06: The funding envelope negotiation. Currently under immense pressure due to inflation and the truncation of Smart Motorway schemes. The 'Enhancements' budget is shrinking, forcing a pivot to 'Renewals' and 'Maintenance', fundamentally changing the architectural focus from building new bypasses to digitizing existing asset management.
The funding envelope for Road Period 3 (2025-2030).
Heavily constrained by inflation and the diversion of funds to the Smart Motorway safety retrofit.
This creates a trade-off: capital enhancements (new roads) are being sacrificed to fund increased Opex/Renewal demands for aging assets like the M6 viaducts.
The strategic funding allocation for 2025-2030.
Heavily constrained by inflation and the need to fix legacy assets (concrete roads program) rather than build new capacity.
  • SVD Control Design Definition: The formal specification of how the radar control *should* work (detect > verify > signal). Mapped against the 'Three Lines of Defence' model. Architectural gap: The definition assumes 100% CCTV coverage availability for verification, which does not match the actual asset uptime statistics.
  • Traffic Regulation Order (Digital TRO): The legal instrument defining speed limits and road usage. Moving from paper-based to Digital TROs is essential for Micromobility and MaaS providers to know legal constraints in real-time. Currently, the cycle time to update a TRO is months; dynamic mobility needs it in minutes. A major blockage in the legislative architecture.
Machine-readable speed limits and closures.
Under the new legislation, a paper TRO in a filing cabinet is legally insufficient for an ASDE defense.
We are rushing to digitize, but legacy local authority interfaces are a blocker.
The digital twin of legal road rules.
You can't have a CAV obeying a speed limit if that limit only exists on a rusty sign or a PDF in a local council archive.
We are struggling to standardise the data model for D-TROs to feed into the National Access Point (NAP) as mandated by EU Delegated Regulation 2015/962 (retained law).
  • DfT Innovation Grant (T-TRIG): Small-scale funding packets (<£100k) from DfT for trial technologies. While architecturally messy, these fund the 'Digital Roads' proofs-of-concept (e.g., graphene asphalt, connected vehicle trials) that don't fit into the rigid RIS capital delivery process. Often fails to scale due to lack of OpEx transition pathways.
  • Capital Budget (RIS Funds): Ring-fenced funding for building new things. Cannot be easily transferred to Operational Expenditure (Opex), leading to the 'Capital rich, Revenue poor' paradox where we build tech we can't afford to maintain.
  • GG 104 Requirements for Safety Risk Assessment: The core safety standard. Updates to this document are the primary mechanism for codifying safety lessons learned into mandatory policy.
The DMRB standard governing safety risk management.
In procurement terms, this is the 'weaponised' document.
Contractors often use GG 104 compliance requirements to justify significant cost variations on smart motorway retrofit programmes or complex traffic management setups.
The 'Bible' for safety governance.
While based on UK law, it is heavily influenced by ISO 31000 and best practices from Rijkswaterstaat.
It is the primary weapon used by the SES Directorate to halt schemes (like Smart Motorways retrofit) that do not meet ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) criteria.
The overarching DMRB standard defining the method for safety risk assessment and ALARP judgments on the National Highways network.
  • Corporate Risk Register: The definitive record of strategic risks (e.g., 'Failure to deliver RIS2 efficiency targets'). Contains sensitive data regarding the legal challenges to DCOs (Development Consent Orders) for schemes like the A428 Black Cat. Access is tightly controlled; updates are often sanitized before reaching DfT.
  • Lane Availability Reporting System (LARS) Data: The data source for calculating the P50 Network Availability KPI. Operations (First Line) are incentivized to keep LARS availability high, which can create perverse incentives to delay necessary maintenance closures.
  • Asset Data Management Manual (ADMM): The theoretical data standard. In reality, major projects deliver 'as-built' data that requires months of cleansing before it can be ingested into the asset management systems (IAM/HART), leaving a dangerous data gap post-handover.
The standard defining data requirements for all SRN assets, ensuring consistency in data handover from construction to operations (Project Control Framework Stage 6).
  • Drainage Asset Management Plan (DAMP): The investment strategy document mandated by ORR to demonstrate how NH maintains drainage assets. There is a disconnect between the DAMP's theoretical investment needs (based on deterioration modeling) and the actual maintenance block funding released by the DfT.
  • RIS3 Statement of Funds Available (SoFA): The definitive DfT financial settlement for 2025-2030. Currently under severe tension due to construction inflation eroding the real value of the £24bn+ indicative envelope. This creates a direct trade-off between the 'Enhancement' pot (A66, LTC) and the 'Renewals' pot required to maintain P50 network availability. Operates under strict Treasury 'Green Book' appraisal rules.
The definitive financial constraint document from DfT.
It is not a static pot; it changes via Change Control.
It splits funding into inflexible 'Capital' and 'Resource' (Opex) ring-fences, creating perverse incentives where we can build a new gantry (CapEx) but struggle to fund the technician to fix it (OpEx).
  • CHARM (Common Highways Agency Rijkswaterstaat Model): A shared architectural blueprint for the next-generation Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS). It represents the attempt to move away from bespoke UK legacy systems to a standard European open architecture, though integration has been slower than planned.
  • Safety Performance Metrics (AFR/LTI/FCI): Critical KPIs derived from HART data: Accident Frequency Rate (AFR), Lost Time Injury (LTI), and Fatalities and Weighted Injuries (FWI). These metrics directly influence the Safety and Performance governance boards and ORR regulatory reporting. Data latency in HART often means these metrics lag behind real-time operational reality.
  • Project Bank Account (PBA): Mechanism mandated to ensure Tier 2/3 suppliers are paid directly, bypassing Tier 1 cash flow holding. Critical for supply chain solvency (post-Carillion logic) but administratively heavy and frequently resisted by DIPs who lose working capital advantages.
  • Incident Log: The structured record of an event, including severity, location (marker post/geo), and timeline, maintained within the Command and Control system for audit trails and performance reporting (e.g., CLEAR initiative metrics).
  • NEC4 Engineering and Construction Contract: The standard form of contract used for major civil engineering works on the SRN. Defined by the Institution of Civil Engineers and mandated by the Cabinet Office, it focuses on collaborative risk management and is the legal basis for the data managed in CEMAR.
  • Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2): The statutory document setting out the long-term investment programme for the Strategic Road Network from 2020 to 2025. It acts as the primary driver for all procurement and supply chain activities, defining the capital outcomes required by the DfT.
DfT funding period 2020-2025.
Many schemes (A66, LTC) have slipped from this period into RIS3 due to inflation and planning delays, creating a 'bow wave' of unfunded commitments.
The statutory document setting out the £27.4bn investment plan for the Strategic Road Network (SRN) from 2020-2025, mandating specific CIP schemes.
The strategic investment plan (currently RIS2, transitioning to RIS3) set by the Department for Transport (DfT), outlining the funding envelope and performance specifications (KPIs) for enhancements to the Strategic Road Network over a five-year distinct period.
The statutory document (currently RIS2, moving to RIS3) setting out the long-term programme for motorways and major A-roads, including the Statement of Funds Available.
  • Project Control Framework (PCF) Product List: The defined list of deliverables (e.g., Economic Assessment Report, Environmental Statement) required at each PCF Stage Gate Review.
Standardized deliverables (e.g., Environmental Assessment Report, Economic Appraisal) required at specific stage gates to progress a scheme.
  • GG 104 Safety Risk Assessment: A formal document required by DMRB GG 104 detailing the safety risk evaluation for a scheme, categorized by risk type (Type A, B, or C) and demonstrating ALARP.
The formal safety case document required by DMRB standard GG 104, outlining hazards, risks, and mitigations for new highway systems.
  • Project Control Framework (PCF): The proprietary standard governance framework and product set used by National Highways to manage the lifecycle of major road projects.
  • DMRB Standards Collection: The suite of Design Manual for Roads and Bridges documents, specifically the G-series (General) and T-series (Technology) governing ITS design.
  • GG 119 Road Safety Audit Standard: DMRB standard mandating independent audit procedures. Updated to reflect recent safety imperatives regarding Vulnerable Users and Smart Motorways.

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSPROCESS (187 components):
----------------------------------------
  • Project Control Framework (PCF) Process: The rigid 7-stage lifecycle (Stage 0 Strategy to Stage 7 Closeout) governing all NH schemes. While designed for assurance, its heavy documentation requirements (SGARs) slow down digital transformation initiatives which require agile delivery, causing friction between IT and Major Projects directorates.
  • Project Control Framework (PCF) Lifecycle: The mandatory governance process for all Major Projects (MP) and Regional Investment Programme (RIP) schemes. It dictates the specific products required for Stages 0-7. Often criticised for being document-heavy, leading to 'green-shifting' where RAG statuses remain Green until immediately before a deadline.
The mandated governance process for managing major projects through stages 0 (Strategy) to 7 (Closeout), ensuring assurance reviews at key investment decision points (SGARs).
  • Route Strategies Governance Cycle (RIS3): The messy, iterative process of synthesizing 18 regional route strategies into a coherent national investment plan. In theory, this is bottom-up evidence gathering; in practice, it's a brutal filtering exercise where regional 'wish lists' collide with HM Treasury fiscal envelopes. It relies heavily on legacy traffic data from HART and asset condition scores (LARS/dIMS) which often contradict regional anecdotal evidence. The process acts as the sanitisation layer before the Strategic Road Network Initial Report (SRNIR) goes to the DfT.
  • Manual Incident Verification (CCTV Pan/Tilt/Zoom): The mandatory human validation step following an automated alert. Requires the operator to locate the specific marker post on the CCTV matrix. Bottleneck: Poor visibility (weather/lighting) or PTZ mechanical failure (legacy asset condition) delays the activation of motorway incident protection, directly impacting the 'Time to Protect' safety metric.
Mandatory manual verification step required by control room policy to prevent false alarms from triggering the massive disruption of a full bore closure.
Tensions exist between this delay and the 'Golden Hour' response principles.
  • Incident Verification (RCC Visual Confirmation): The mandatory 'eyes on' process performed by RCC Operators at centres like Quinton or Godstone before signals can be fully trusted. dictated by GD 304. Process bottleneck: Operators must pan/tilt CCTV to verify SVD alerts, creating a dangerous time-lag (measured in seconds) between detection and 'Red X' activation on gantries.
  • Scene Evidence Capture (Forensic Collision Investigation): Police-led process for fatal or life-changing injury collisions (Category 1). This is the primary bottleneck for operational clearance, as Police primacy supersedes NH availability targets. Digital photogrammetry and laser scanning are used here, but often delay debris removal authorization, creating a 'stand-off' phase in the control room logs.
  • Statutory Vehicle Removal (SVR) Execution: The physical recovery of assets using the National Vehicle Recovery Manager (NVRM) contract. This process involves the categorization of recovery (Light, Heavy, Super Heavy) and creates operational drag when specialist equipment (e.g., rotators for overturned HGVs) must be deployed to locations like the A14 or M6, often delayed by cross-boundary contractor handovers.
  • Carriageway Debris and Hydrocarbon Clearance: Specialist cleaning required to meet DMRB safety standards before reopening. Involves deploying hydro-blasters for fuel spills to restore skid resistance (measured against CS 228). A critical failure point where 'visual clean' does not match 'chemical clean', risking secondary incidents if rushed to meet open-road targets.
  • Emergency VRS Repair Assessment: Immediate assessment of Vehicle Restraint Systems (barriers) against CD 377. The trade-off decision involves implementing temporary 50mph speed limits (hard shoulder running restricted) versus full closure for immediate repair. This decision impacts the 'Late Running Interventions' metric.
  • Disseminate 'Operational Learning' via Yammer/SharePoint: The informal mechanism for sharing lessons learned (e.g., 'Best practice for EV fires on A14'). While there are formal channels, the reality is that Ops Managers rely on ad-hoc internal communication networks. This results in siloed knowledge where Region 5 (South East) might solve a specific ERA (Emergency Refuge Area) signage issue that Region 9 (Midlands) is still struggling with.
  • 6-on-4-off Shift Rotation: The standard operational rhythm (Early, Late, Night) designed to ensure 24/7 coverage. Tension: This rigid pattern clashes with the 'demand-led' rostering required to cover peak seasonal flows or major events (e.g., Silverstone GP, Glastonbury), leading to high overtime dependency and union friction.
  • Visual Incident Verification: The mandatory manual step before 'Confirmed Incident' status. Operator steers CCTV to SVD coordinates. Average latency: 45-90 seconds. If CCTV is obscured (fog/glare), protocol dictates dispatching a Traffic Officer 'blind', impacting resource utilisation.
  • Resource Dispatch Logic (Triage & Assignment): The algorithmic and human decision tree used to deploy assets. Prioritises 'Life Risk' (Category 1) over 'Congestion' (Category 2). Heavily influenced by the 'Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake' commitments to reduce attendance times to <10 minutes in ALR sections. Balancing act: Dispatching nearest TO vs. holding unit for potential secondary incidents.
  • Post-Incident Cold Debrief: Formal review for Major Incidents (e.g., fatal collisions, >3hr closure). Focuses on timeline analysis against the 'Gold Command' log. Accountability gap: often identifies systemic failures (e.g., poor inter-agency comms) that cannot be fixed by Operations alone due to Police operational independence.
  • Execute Scene Protection (Red X / Lane Closure): Setting TSRGD-compliant signals to close lanes 1-4. Criticality: On ALR schemes (e.g., M1 J13-16), this is the ONLY protection for stranded motorists. Dependency: Relies on motorist compliance; non-compliance creates massive safety risk for Traffic Officers.
  • Unverified SVD Alert Verification: The manual bottleneck in the digital loop. An RCC operator must pan/tilt a CCTV camera to visually confirm a radar alert before setting a Red X. This human-in-the-loop requirement currently prevents fully automated protection of stranded vehicles, a key friction point in the Smart Motorway Evidence Stocktake.
  • Severe Weather Response Activation (GS 801): Operational cascade mandated by DMRB GS 801 (formerly AM 900). Involves transitioning from 'monitoring' to 'active intervention'. Friction point: Handover lag between Regional Control Centres (RCCs) and on-road Traffic Officer units when local weather stations (ESS) disagree with regional forecasts.
The operational process triggered during snow/flood.
Relies on the interplay between NTOC (Strategic) and RCCs (Tactical).
Friction occurs when regional resources (gritters) are hoarded by areas not yet impacted, defying national redistribution logic.
Operational process triggered when Met Office alerts hit thresholds.
Requires coordination between NTOC and regional depots to deploy gritters.
Currently relies on manual decision-making, despite the availability of road surface temperature sensors that could automate the dispatch.
Cultural resistance to 'algorithm-led' salting remains high.
Winter service delivery.
Tension point: The decision to deploy gritters (Precautionary Treatment) relies on domain-specific weather forecasting (MeteoGroup) which sometimes conflicts with local observations by Traffic Officers, leading to 'phantom' runs or missed hazards.
  • Incident Command Handover (Gold/Silver/Bronze): Formal transfer of authority. In reality, a blurred line during the 'Assessment' phase of a major incident. Police Force Incident Managers (FIM) often retain control of the carriageway longer than necessary under Civil Contingencies Act powers, destroying NH's 'Journey Time Reliability' stats.
  • Conduct SCANNER Pavement Surveys: Annual automated traffic-speed condition surveys (TRACS) mandated by CS 229. SCANNER vehicles collect texture depth, rutting, and cracking data. Operational friction occurs when survey windows clash with roadworks, leading to data gaps in LARS (Lane Availability Reporting System).
  • Perform Principal Bridge Inspections: 6-yearly detailed hands-on inspection of structures per CS 450. Requires extensive traffic management (TM). Friction arises when budget cuts force the deferral of these inspections, increasing the hidden risk profile of post-tensioned concrete bridges.
  • Model Asset Deterioration (Pavement): Uses dTIMS and bespoke logic to predict pavement failure. The process is constrained by the quality of historical construction data—many legacy sections of the A1 or A66 lack accurate 'as-built' depth records, forcing conservative (expensive) intervention modelling.
  • Validate ADMM Data Compliance: The gatekeeper process at scheme handover (ADMM - Asset Data Management Manual). Frequently bypassed or 'conditioned' to allow road opening (e.g., A14 opening), resulting in a backlog of as-built data updates that degrades the accuracy of the HASS inventory.
  • Annual TRACS/SCANNER Network Survey: Mandatory annual high-speed road surface condition survey covering 100% of the SRN (Strategic Road Network). Utilizes laser profilometry to measure texture depth, rutting, and ride quality. Critical input for determining the KPI 'Percentage of Network in Good Condition' monitored by the ORR. Often disrupted by roadworks on major schemes like the A428 Black Cat.
  • PCF Stage 6 Commissioning and Handover: The operational chokepoint. Theoretically, assets are not accepted by Operations until ADMM compliant. In reality, political pressure to 'open the road' often forces Operations to grant 'Conditional Acceptance', effectively inheriting a data debt that consumes Opex budgets for years to rectify.
  • Optimise Renewal Investment (Value Management): The 'battleground' where regional engineering teams bid for funding against the national model. Area teams use local knowledge to override algorithmic recommendations, often citing safety risks (GG 104) that the model misses. Results in the 'Area Forward Programme'.
  • Value Management & Investment Prioritisation (RIS Cycle): The iterative process of whittling down the 'unconstrained need' (the theoretical renewal cost) to the 'constrained budget' (the DfT settlement). Uses the outcome of deterioration models to score schemes against Safety (GG 104), Customer (ride quality), and Efficiency metrics. Current friction: The 'efficiency challenge' often forces the deferral of interventions from 'optimal time' to 'safety critical time', creating a growing backlog of 'Amber' condition assets.
  • Principal Inspection (PI) Execution: High-intensity, hands-on examination requiring close access (underbridge units, roped access). Mandated by CS 450. For complex assets like the Dartford Crossing or Severn Bridges, this requires significant network downtime, clashing with the '97% lane availability' KPI. Includes Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) for hidden defects (e.g., half-cell potential for rebar corrosion).
  • Reactive Jetting and Silt Removal: Emergency response to blocked carrier drains. This is 'OpEx bleed'—expensive, unplanned work triggered by storm events that overrides planned maintenance. Frequently required on the A14 and M62 corridors due to aging clay pipes.
  • DCO Pre-Application Phase: Critical preparatory phase for NSIPs (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects) involving EIA scoping, statutory consultation (Statement of Community Consultation), and preliminary design. Failure here leads to PINS non-acceptance. Heavy reliance on supply chain (Arup, Jacobs) for volume production of Environmental Statements.
Modified governance process removing sequential gates between preliminary design and statutory consultation.
Risks 'consulting on immaturity', leading to higher examination questions.
Requires strict adherence to Planning Act 2008 s42 duties despite compressed timelines.
  • DCO Acceptance Phase: Strict 28-day review period by the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) to determine if the application meets Section 55 of the Planning Act 2008 standards. A 'No' here is catastrophic for RIS delivery schedules (e.g., Lower Thames Crossing early delays).
  • DCO Recommendation and Decision Phase: 3-month PINS reporting period followed by 3-month Secretary of State (DfT) decision window. Highly political; often extended (e.g., A303 Stonehenge, A66 Northern Trans-Pennine) due to complex legal frameworks around Carbon and Heritage.
  • Scheme Handback and PCF Stage 6: The critical transition phase where Major Projects assets (e.g., A428, A66) are transferred to Operations. Historically a point of failure where 'as-built' data does not match physical reality, leading to immediate operational risks and maintenance voids. Often rushed to meet 'Open for Traffic' political milestones.
  • Value Engineering Workshop (PCF Stage 3): The critical friction point where design specifications are reduced to meet the RIS Funding Envelope. Often prioritises initial Capex reduction over Totex, trading concrete step barriers for steel or reducing drainage attenuation capacity.
  • Statutory Consultation (Planning Act 2008 s42/s47/s48): Rigid, legally mandated consultation period for NSIPs (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects) like Lower Thames Crossing and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine. Failure here attracts Judicial Review risks. It is not merely 'engagement' but a statutory hurdle where design freezes often conflict with evolving stakeholder demands. Governed by PINS advice notes.
  • Route Strategy Evidence Consolidation Phase: The initial phase of the route strategy cycle where regional teams scrape operational data to justify interventions. Relies heavily on the 'Strategy and Planning' directorate aggregating fragmented datasets from NTIS (traffic flow), GDMS (geotech), and HAPMS (pavement) to form a 'baseline state'. This process is currently high-friction due to data quality issues in legacy systems before migration to HART is complete.
  • Problem Identification & Gap Analysis: Mapping evidence against performance targets. Specifically identifying locations failing the P50 journey time reliability metric and safety clusters defined by DMRB GG 104 (Safety Risk Assessment). This process often reveals a disconnect between Regional Operations (who care about maintainability) and Strategy (who care about BCR and capacity).
  • Option Generation & Sifting: Developing potential interventions. Options range from 'Technology' (Variable Speed Limits) to 'Complex Infrastructure' (Lower Thames Crossing). Teams must now apply the 'Road to Zero' lens, often filtering out capacity schemes that induce demand, in favour of safety and renewal focused works.
  • DfT Remit & Affordability Envelope Determination (2024): The 'Crunch'. DfT and Treasury determining the financial envelope. The delay here is palpable. This process is currently filtering out high-risk schemes. The 'Smart Motorways Stocktake' outcome has effectively killed ALR rollout, forcing a pivot to safety retrofits.
  • RIS3 Final Settlement & Delivery Plan (2026): The finalized contract. Will lock in the Performance Specification (KPIs). We expect a shift from 'P50 Journey Time' to stricter 'Asset Availability' metrics to force us to manage roadworks better.
  • Horizon Scanning (TRL & Academia): Identification of emerging TRL 1-3 technologies. heavily reliant on the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) and partnerships like Midlands Future Mobility. Often generates high-potential concepts (e.g., graphene asphalt, inductive charging) that stall because they cannot be mapped to existing Asset Delivery contract incentives.
  • CS 450 Structural Inspection Regime (RIS2/RIS3): The codified workflow for managing SRN structure safety. While the legacy baseline was rigid (GI: 2-yearly, PI: 6-yearly), current operations push for Risk-Based Intervals (RBI) to stretch Opex budgets under RIS3 constraints. This creates tension between extending asset life and the immediate cost of hands-on access, particularly for the M5/M6 Midland Links viaducts and post-tensioned concrete stock.
  • DCO Examination Phase: Statutory 6-month inquisitorial process involving Issue Specific Hearings (ISH), Compulsory Acquisition Hearings, and written representations. Examining Authority interrogates the 'Red Line Boundary' and Limits of Deviation against DMRB standards.
  • Pipeline Prioritisation & DfT Challenge: The political filtering phase. The 'technically correct' list of schemes from the Route Strategy is re-ordered based on the DfT's funding envelope for RIS3 and political imperatives (Levelling Up). This is where the 'A66 Northern Trans-Pennine' gains priority despite lower BCRs compared to southern schemes.
  • Scheme Sifting & Portfolio Optimization (2025): The 'Trade-off' engine. We are running scenarios: High Renewals/Low Enhancement vs Balanced. Schemes like A428 Black Cat are committed (RIS2 carry-over), but pipeline schemes like pipeline schemes entering DCO (e.g., A12 Chelmsford) are being value-engineered to death to fit the envelope.
  • Connected Corridor Pilot Execution (A2/M2): Real-world testing of V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communications and GLOSA (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory) on the A2/M2. Operational reality: Data flow is hampered by legacy roadside cabinets and lack of fiber backhaul, requiring ad-hoc 4G/5G workarounds that aren't scalable for national rollout.
  • Tender Moderation Panel: The friction point where Quality, Price, and Social Value scores meet. Chaired by a non-voting commercial lead. Here, the trade-off between a 'low cost' bid (high commercial score) and a 'high confidence' delivery plan (high technical score) is argued. Often results in clarify questions regarding GG 104 safety cases.
  • Strategic Supplier Relationship Management (SRM): The formal board-to-board governance process for Tier 1 partners. distinct from day-to-day contract management. Focuses on long-term capability, innovation (Connected & Autonomous Plant), and financial health checks to prevent another Carillion-style collapse.
  • Social Value Tender Evaluation (10% Weighting): The procurement process step where the 10% score is awarded. This is where the 'gaming' happens—bidders promise aggressive TOMs targets to win, creating a 'delivery gap' risk for the Project Manager later.
  • Financial Distress Monitoring (Tier 1 & Critical Tier 2): Continuous assessment of supplier liquidity using Dunn & Bradstreet APIs and manual credit checks. Specifically targets high-exposure partners on the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine and Lower Thames Crossing to prevent Carillion-style insolvency events affecting critical path delivery.
  • GG 104 Hazard Identification & Risk Evaluation: The core analytical process requiring identifying hazards (e.g., stopped vehicle detection failure) and evaluating risks against tolerability criteria. Currently undergoing intense scrutiny following the Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake, specifically regarding the frequency of 'live lane' breakdown scenarios on ALR (All Lane Running) sections.
  • Safe System of Work (SSoW) & Permit to Work Planning: Operational process for establishing safe working zones, governed by TSRGD and Chapter 8 of the Traffic Signs Manual. Tension exists here between maximizing 'road space availability' (a key ORR metric) and granting sufficient possession windows for safe renewal works on high-traffic corridors like the M25 and M6 J13-15.
  • Incident Investigation & Root Cause Analysis (statutory): Post-event analysis process utilizing STATS19 data and RAID (Road Accident In-Depth Studies). It feeds into RIDDOR reporting to the HSE. There is a notable lag in this process where legacy data formats from local police forces slow down the integration of lessons learned into the wider Safety Management System.
  • Safety Critical Competence Management (Lantra/CSCS): Process to verify that workforce personnel (Traffic Officers and Supply Chain) hold valid qualifications (e.g., NHSS Sector Schemes). Accountability is often blurred here due to the tiered supply chain structure, making it difficult to enforce uniform competence standards across Tier 2 and Tier 3 contractors.
  • Collision Cluster Identification & Causation Analysis: The annual process of analyzing STATS19 data to identify 'Sites of Concern'. Involves filtering out driver error to find infrastructure causation (e.g., poor skid resistance requiring resurfacing). Currently heavily focused on the breakdown of Smart Motorway safety metrics following the 2020 Evidence Stocktake.
  • Road Safety Audit (GG 119) Lifecycle: Mandatory four-stage audit process (Stage 1: Preliminary Design to Stage 4: 12-months Post-Opening). This is the primary friction point in delivery; independent auditors frequently identify non-compliances in 'value-engineered' schemes (e.g., A428 Black Cat), forcing costly late-stage redesigns or retrospective mitigation.
  • Remedial Measure Design (CD 123 & CD 109): Engineering design phase for identified safety defects. Strictly governed by CD 123 (Geometric Design) and CD 109 (Highway Link Design). Engineers often must apply for 'Departures from Standard' via the DAS (Departures Approval System) when retrofitting safety barriers (CS 228) into narrow central reserves.
  • Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Scoping: The battleground where scheme scope is fought. We trade off cost against the mitigation hierarchy (Avoid, Reduce, Mitigate, Compensate). Current friction point: A303 Stonehenge heritage impacts vs. tunnel engineering realities.
  • Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) Execution: Where the rubber hits the road. The translation of high-level DCO promises into muddy boots reality. Requires strict adherence to DMRB GG 120. Frequent failure point: Contractors ignoring 'protected species' exclusionary zones to meet paving schedules.
  • UKHab Classification Survey (Baseline): Pre-construction ecological survey following UK Habitat Classification system standards. Must be conducted by competent ecologists to establish the pre-intervention biodiversity unit value. Data quality here is a frequent point of failure; poor baselining leads to impossible net gain targets later in the RIP (Road Investment Strategy) lifecycle.
  • Carbon Data Reporting (SECR/Greener Roads): The quarterly aggregation of fuel, energy, and material data from the supply chain (Tier 1s). Data quality is often poor; contractors estimate rather than measure, leading to 'carbon gaps' in our annual report to DfT and ORR.
  • Safety Critical Medical Assessment: Fitness-for-task screening (vision, hearing, cardiovascular) mandated for Traffic Officers under Constructing Better Health (CBH) standards. Failure here directly impacts operational headcount and roster availability.
  • Pavement Renewal (Resurfacing) Process: The core maintenance activity. Driven by HAPMS/LARS data. Tension exists between 'intervention criteria' (technical need based on TRACS data) and 'customer ride quality' complaints. Funding cuts often force surface dressing (patching) rather than deep reconstruction.
  • Supply Chain Payment (Project Bank Accounts): The process of paying Tier 1/2 contractors. Failure here (due to Oracle glitches) stops work on the A428 immediately and damages DfT confidence.
  • Asset Data Handover (ADMM): Moving 'As-Built' data from construction (ProjectWise) to maintenance (IAM IS) following DMRB ADMM (Asset Data Management Manual). This remains a manual, error-prone bottleneck.
  • Quarterly Social Value Verification: The operational grind where Project Managers must sign off contractor claims (e.g., 'did you really volunteer 50 hours at that school?'). Often deprioritised against safety (GG 104) and schedule pressures.
  • Cost Verification and Substantiation: The forensic process of validating supply chain costs against NEC4 Option C (Target Cost) contracts. Involves physical site measurement (validating earthworks volumes on schemes like A303 Stonehenge) and checking payroll records against 'Schedule of Cost Components'. This process is the primary bottleneck in monthly payment cycles.
  • Commercial Assurance & NEC4 Management: The defense mechanism against contractor claims. Teams are overwhelmed assessing 'Compensation Events' related to material price fluctuations, creating a backlog that obscures the true 'Final Forecast Cost' of the capital programme.
  • GG 104 Safety Governance & Assurance Framework: The overarching safety governance process defined by DMRB standard GG 104. It mandates the 'Safety Risk Assessment' and 'Safety Governance' requirements for all schemes on the SRN, including the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine and Lower Thames Crossing. This process often faces friction when 'ALARP' (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) justifications conflict with RIS2 efficiency targets and capital constraints.
  • Safety Performance Monitoring & Leading Indicator Analysis: Continuous monitoring of safety metrics (KSI rates, LTIFR) against RIS2 targets. Heavily reliant on data from HALOGEN and incident logs. A key architectural gap is the lack of real-time predictive indicators, forcing reliance on lagging metrics reported to the ORR.
  • Winter Maintenance (Salting): The application of brine/salt to the SRN (DMRB GM 701) to prevent ice. A critical safety process that directly degrades the roadside soft estate biodiversity, creating a chemical conflict between 'Safety' (P50 availability) and 'Environment' (Soil chemistry/vegetation health).
  • Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) Activation: Peer-delivered psychological support process activated after major incidents (e.g., multi-fatality crossovers). Critical for preventing PTSD in Traffic Officers, but often delayed due to shift pattern constraints and resource shortages.
  • Lone Worker Monitoring (Peoplesafe): Digital check-in process for solo Traffic Officers. Reliance on cellular network coverage creates blind spots on parts of the A66 and A303, necessitating fallback radio protocols.
  • Incident Management & Recovery: The core operational loop: Detect (SVD/MIDAS) -> Verify (CCTV) -> Respond (Traffic Officer/Signals) -> Recover. Governed strictly by DMRB GG 104 safety risk requirements. Performance is measured against the 'Clearance of incidents affecting traffic flow' KPI.
  • GG 104 Safety Risk Assessment (ALARP Demonstration): The DMRB standard methodology for assessing safety risk. For tunnels like the A38 Saltash or A27 Southwick, this isn't just a checkbox; it's a quantitative analysis comparing tunnel risks against the 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' benchmark. Tensions arise when legacy infrastructure requires disproportionate funding to meet modern ALARP standards, forcing trade-offs with pavement renewal budgets.
  • Tunnel Closure & Evacuation Protocol (Code Red): The sequence of dropping barriers, activating PA/VA, and illuminating emergency exits. This process overrides all other traffic objectives and immediately destroys the Journey Time Reliability metric for that reporting period.
  • Tunnel Emergency Closure Sequence (CD 352): The automated workflow triggered by Fire Detection or Stopped Vehicle Detection. 1. Drop barriers. 2. Activate Red X (TSRGD compliant). 3. Ramp up ventilation. 4. Switch lighting to emergency levels. Requires 99.99% reliability under the Safety Case.
  • TIMS (Traffic Incident Management Service) Response: Operational procedures for Traffic Officers (TOs). Currently assumes human interaction. Procedures must update to handle 'No User-in-Charge' vehicles. If a NUIC vehicle blocks a lane on the M25, TOs have no legal framework to force-move it without ASDE consent.
  • Traffic Officer Incident Response: The physical process of clearing the carriageway. If a Level 4 CAV breaks down in a live lane (A14 or M6), the TO interaction manual needs rewriting. Currently, TOs rely on hand signals and verbal communication—useless for a driverless pod. This is a critical operational gap.
  • Tunnel Hazmat Incident Response (CD 352): Emergency containment protocol activated upon ADR breach or fire. Involves shutting bore access (Red X), activating deluge systems (if present), and coordinating with local Fire & Rescue Services. Success is measured against 'time to suppression' and 'safe egress time' calculated in the safety case.
  • Incident Detection and Verification: The T0-T1 timeline. Currently relies on MIDAS trigger -> Operator verification via CCTV. High manual workload. The 'human in the loop' is the current latency bottleneck.
The critical 'Time to Verify' metric.
The architectural gap: moving from reactive (waiting for a 999 call or MIDAS loop trigger) to proactive (connected vehicle telemetry).
Currently, a manual bottleneck exists where an operator must visually confirm a stopped vehicle before setting 'Red X' signals (DMRB GG 104 compliance).
The operational process of identifying anomalies on the network using MIDAS alerts, Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) radar on Smart Motorways (ALR), and CCTV visual confirmation.
This process triggers the initial response within the RCC.
The operational process of identifying potential incidents via MIDAS alerts, 999 calls, or CCTV sweeps, and visually confirming the nature of the event to determine the required response (e.g., STRI - Stationary Vehicle Detection).
The operational process performed by RCC operators to identify and confirm unannounced incidents on the SRN.
Involves monitoring alerts from MIDAS loops, analyzing stopped vehicle detection (SVD) radar data on ALR (All Lane Running) Smart Motorways, and validating via CCTV infrastructure to ensure GG 104 safety compliance before resource deployment.
  • CAV Transition Planning (RIS2 to RIS4): Strategic coordination of the mixed-traffic transition (2025-2040). This isn't just about 'self-driving cars'; it's about managing the friction between legacy human drivers and ALKS (Automated Lane Keeping Systems). It specifically addresses the tension between the 'Digital Roads' vision and the reality of P50 paving constraints. Critical path includes aligning DCO applications for the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine with required fibre ducting standards.
  • Strategic Workforce Planning & Demand Forecasting: The critical process of modeling resource requirements against the Road Investment Strategy (RIS) delivery portfolio. Specifically focuses on the tension between internal engineering capability and the reliance on the 'Extended Enterprise' (Tier 1 delivery partners like Balfour Beatty, Skanska) for schemes like A428 and A66. Often fails to accurately predict specialist shortages in ITS and asset management.
  • Specialist Talent Acquisition & Onboarding: Recruitment focusing on hard-to-fill technical roles (structures engineers, ITS architects) where NH competes directly with the supply chain. Includes security vetting for control centre staff (NTOC, RCCs) and specific onboarding for safety-critical roles under DMRB GG 104 requirements. Bottlenecks often occur here due to civil service pay bands vs market rates.
  • Performance Management & Reward Linkage: Annual cycle of objective setting linked to DfT KPIs (Safety, User Satisfaction, Delivery). Operationalised via the 'My Performance' module in Oracle. Friction exists in applying standard corporate objectives to rostered Traffic Officers and Control Room operators whose metrics are response times and availability, not strategic milestones.
  • Conduct Spending Review Negotiation: The high-stakes strategic dance for RIS3 funding. Involves translating asset condition data (LARS/HART) and capacity models into economic cases compliant with HMT Green Book. Tension: Current inflation renders RIS2 baseline assumptions obsolete, requiring constant re-litigation of value for money.
  • Operationalise Annual Budget Circular: Translating the high-level RIS settlement into directorate-level control totals. This is where the 'efficiency squeeze' is applied. We allocate budgets to Major Projects (A66, A428) and Operations based on the Delivery Plan, often front-loading efficiency targets that haven't actually been realised yet.
  • Execute DfT Grant Drawdown: The monthly cash management ritual. We don't hold cash reserves; we draw down from DfT based on immediate need. Requires precise forecasting from the supply chain (Tier 1s). Poor forecasting leads to 'variance' discussions with DfT and impacts our credibility for future funding requests.
  • Crisis Communications Activation Protocol (Gold Command): The high-latency workflow triggered during major network events (Critical Incident/Major Incident). It coordinates messaging between NTOC, Gold Command, and the DfT Press Office. specifically used during Operation Brock (M20 Kent resilience) and severe weather events (Operation Ophelia). Friction often occurs here due to the approval lag time required by DfT ministers before NH can release definitive statements to the media.
  • Development Consent Order (DCO) Statutory Consultation: The legally mandated consultation process under the Planning Act 2008 for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP). Currently managing the immense data intake for the Lower Thames Crossing (LTC) and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine. This process is a massive resource sink, requiring the ingestion of thousands of public representations into analysis databases to demonstrate compliance to the Planning Inspectorate.
  • National Traffic Information Service (NTIS) Dissemination: The automated publishing of traffic data to the NVRM (National Vehicle Recovery Manager) and media outlets. While technically an operational process, it is the primary 'Communication' channel for 99% of customers. Tensions exist when the 'Virtual VMS' data on third-party apps (Google/Waze) contradicts the physical VMS signals set by RCC Godstone or NTOC.
  • A303 Stonehenge Heritage Communication: A specific, ring-fenced communication workflow managing the extreme sensitivity of the World Heritage Site tunnel scheme. It involves specialized engagement with UNESCO and English Heritage, operating almost entirely separately from standard regional communications due to the high risk of judicial review.
  • Capital Programme Efficiency Reporting: The mandatory process of aggregating scheme costs (A428, A303, etc.) against the Performance Specification. This process is currently heavily manual, creating a risk of regulatory censure from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) regarding the £1.7bn efficiency target. The new FFBS programme must automate this, but the data granularity required for 'Unit Cost' analysis is fighting against the standardisation of the new cloud ERP.
  • Category Management (Procurement): The shift from transactional purchasing to strategic category management across the Regional Delivery Partnerships (RDP). The tension here is that Procurement wants to standardise components (e.g., gantries, barriers) to lower costs, while Major Projects (A428, Lower Thames Crossing) argue that site-specific constraints require bespoke engineering deviations from DMRB.
  • Parliamentary Question (PQ) Rapid Response Cycle: A high-stress, 4-hour turnaround process triggered by DfT Ministers. Often demands granular operational data (e.g., 'How many SVD alerts were false positives on the M1 J10-13 last week?') that our systems (HART/HALOGEN) were never designed to report on instantly. Results in manual data scraping by analysts.
  • Major Projects Public Consultation Analysis: The statutory process for NSIPs (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects) like Lower Thames Crossing. This is where the 'transparency' war is fought. We have to publish Preliminary Environmental Information Reports (PEIR), but often hold back detailed traffic modelling, leading to accusations of obfuscation during DCO examination.
  • Incident-Driven Asset Remediation: The reactionary workflow triggered when a vehicle strikes infrastructure (e.g., VRS on A66). Unlike planned maintenance, this bypasses standard optimization logic, burning through the Area's lump sum budget and creating tension between 'Make Safe' (Ops) and 'Permanent Repair' (Asset) standards.
  • Winter Maintenance Decision Making: The daily gamble made by severe weather officers. Uses domain specific data (Precipitation, Road Surface Temp) to deploy gritters. A tension point: Asset Management wants to conserve salt stocks (Inventory management), Operations prioritises zero liability (Risk avoidance).
  • Monthly Performance Review (MPR) Cascade: The ritualistic governance cycle where Regional Directors explain red KPI metrics to ExCo. Often focuses on 'explaining away' data anomalies caused by the NTIS/HART disconnect rather than addressing root cause operational behaviors.
  • Technical Learning & Development (L&D): Management of professional competence and statutory safety training. Critical for maintaining the 'Traffic Officer Passport' and engineering ticketing. Governs the delivery of training for Smart Motorway signaling (HART/CHARM) and roadside safety. If this process fails, we breach the Health & Safety at Work Act.
  • HR Operations & Shared Services: Transactional backbone handling payroll, benefits, and absence management via Oracle HCM Cloud. Critical for ensuring accurate pay for complex shift patterns (shift allowance, overtime) for the Traffic Officer Service. Data quality issues here frequently impact operational reporting.
  • RIS3 Portfolio Risk Profiling: The strategic process of stripping scope from the Roads Investment Strategy 3 pipeline to match diminishing real-term funding. Involves trade-offs between asset renewal (pavement/structures) and enhancement schemes (like A46 Newark Bypass), often resulting in deferred maintenance risk.
  • PCF Stage 6 Handover & Commissioning: The formal Project Control Framework stage for transferring assets. In reality, a chaotic negotiation where 'Certificate of Completion' is often issued with a snagging list (Annex 13) so extensive it creates an unfunded OpEx liability for the region.
The Project Control Framework stage where the H&S File is formally transferred from Major Projects to Operations.
This is the architectural bottleneck: Operations often reject the file due to poor data quality or lack of GG 104 compliance evidence, delaying scheme close-out and capitalization.
  • Departure from Standard (WebDAS) Approval Cycle: The bureaucratic process where engineering reality meets regulatory compliance. It involves the submission of a departure application via the legacy WebDAS system, review by SES specialists, and potential escalation to the Chief Highway Engineer. This process frequently introduces undefined latency into the Critical Path of scheme delivery.
  • DMRB Departure from Standard Approval: The bureaucratic bottleneck where engineering non-compliance requests (WebDAS system) accumulate. Delays here directly stall the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine and LTC DCO progress due to resource scarcity in the SES directorate.
  • Execute Post Opening Project Evaluation (POPE): The retrospective analysis of Major Projects (e.g., A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon) 1-5 years after opening. Measures actual traffic flows and safety benefits against the Business Case promises. Critical for RIS3 evidence but often ignored by delivery teams who have moved to the next scheme.
The retrospective reckoning.
Did the scheme deliver the claimed Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)?
We analyse journey times (NTIS data) and safety stats (STATS19).
Tension: These reports come years too late to influence current design decisions, creating a learning lag in the architecture.
  • Manage Departures from Standards (DfS): The process where engineers request permission to deviate from DMRB requirements. This is where the *real* knowledge lives—identifying where standards don't fit reality. Currently managed via WebDris.
The technical approval process for designs that deviate from DMRB requirements.
Requires submission via the DAS (Departures Approval System) and review by National Highways Safety, Engineering and Standards (SES) technical specialists.
  • Strategic Horizon Scanning & Emerging Risk Identification: Forward-looking process identifying threats to the SRN, such as Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) cyber-security vulnerabilities or climate resilience failures (e.g., A38 drainage capacity). Often sidelined by immediate operational fires, leading to reactive scrambling during extreme weather events.
  • National Crisis Management (Gold Command) Activation: High-level strategic response process. Invoked during National Incidents (e.g., Operation Brock on M20, severe weather events). Often bypassed in practice by local RCC Silver Command due to latency in decision-making chains.
  • Major Projects Project Control Framework (PCF) Process: The rigorous, bureaucratic lifecycle management process (Stages 0-7) for delivering RIS schemes. While intended to ensure quality, it often creates perverse incentives where teams rush to pass 'Gateways' to secure capital funding release, sometimes carrying forward unresolved design risks (e.g., geotechnical uncertainties on the A303 Stonehenge) that explode into cost overruns later during construction.
  • Control Effectiveness Review (Smart Motorways): The assurance process validating that Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) meets the performance specification (detecting 80% of stopped vehicles within 20 seconds). Operational reality: The testing methodology (sampling) often yields higher theoretical performance than the empirical experience of Traffic Officers on the ground.
  • Strategic Horizon Scanning & Intelligence: The formalized process of identifying RIS3/RIS4 disruptors. Often operates in a silo within the Strategy & Planning directorate, disconnected from the 'muddy boots' reality of Regional Operations Centres (ROCs). It theoretically informs the Road Investment Strategy but frequently clashes with the immediate fire-fighting required by legacy asset failures and severe weather events.
  • Signal Detection: Weak Signal Analysis: Monitoring early warnings from TRL (Transport Research Laboratory) reports, supply chain insolvency data, and Met Office long-range forecasts. Critical for spotting 'Black Swans' like the semiconductor shortage that crippled roadside technology rollouts. Often hampered by poor data quality in HART (Highway Analyst and Reporting Tool).
  • RIS3 Scenario Planning: Developing investment scenarios for Road Investment Strategy 3 (2025-2030). Involves trade-offs between 'Enhancement' (new schemes like Lower Thames Crossing) and 'Renewals' (fixing concrete roads). Heavily scrutinized by the ORR (Office of Rail and Road) regarding efficiency and the DfT regarding benefit-cost ratios (BCR).
  • Severe Weather Incident Response (Plan 7/8): Operational protocols executed by NTOC and Regional Control Centres (e.g., RCC South West for M5/A38 flooding) during Met Office Amber/Red warnings. Triggers lowering of variable speed limits via NTIS to manage hydroplaning risk and deployment of Traffic Officers to strategic holding points.
  • Compensation Event Assessment: The critical friction process. When Major Projects identifies a change (e.g., unknown ground conditions requiring CD 622 geotechnical remediation), they raise a CE. Commercial must validate entitlement. This process frequently delays payments and strains supply chain cash flow.
  • Red X Signal Activation (TSRGD Compliance): Mandatory lane closure process. Must comply with Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD). Latency between operator command in HART and physical signal change on the gantry is a critical safety risk during high-speed live lane incidents.
  • Asset Renewal Planning (Value Management): The chaotic annual cycle where regions bid for capital maintenance cash. ostensibly data-led via IAM IS (Integrated Asset Management), but in reality, 'he who shouts loudest' or has the most critical safety defects (Category 1) wins, undermining long-term preventative maintenance strategies defined in PAS 55/ISO 55000.
  • Conduct Fatal Collision Investigation (FCI): The forensic process following a fatal incident on the SRN. Involves collaboration with Police Forensic Collision Investigators. Outputs often lag behind real-time operations due to legal privilege during active criminal proceedings.
  • Operational Risk Mitigation & Control Design: The practical application of controls (e.g., deploying additional Traffic Officers to the M6 during roadworks). Involves trade-offs: utilizing the Operation Brock contraflow reduces M20 risk but spikes regional congestion metrics, negatively impacting the User Satisfaction score.
  • Operational Technology (OT) Fallback Execution: The 'Dark Mode' procedure. When CHARM or legacy traffic systems fail, RCC operators revert to manual signal setting or deploying Traffic Officers. Critical operational gap: reliance on voice comms when data links are severed.
  • Severe Weather Response Protocol: Activation of winter fleets and gritters. Governed by the Severe Weather Plan. Critical dependency on accurate road surface temperature sensors. When this process activates, all non-essential maintenance (Business As Usual) stops. It reveals the resource tension: the same supply chain partners used for capital delivery are diverted to gritting, delaying scheme completions.
  • GG 128 Incident Investigation and Learning Cycle: The operational workflow triggered by a safety event on the SRN or construction sites. Includes immediate notification, investigation assignment (Level 1/2/3 based on severity), root cause analysis, and countermeasure verification. Currently, this process is heavily administrative within HART, often delaying the 'learning' loop required to prevent recurrence of high-risk events like IPV (Impact Protection Vehicle) strikes on smart motorway renewal schemes.
  • Connected & Autonomous Vehicle (Cav) Infrastructure Readiness Process: Implied endpoint for RealizationRelationship to Connected & Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) Infrastructure Readiness
  • Road Space Booking and Validation Process: The operational workflow governed by the 'Network Occupancy' standard. Tensions exist here: Delivery Integration Partners (DIPs) on schemes like A66 or A428 fight for space against routine maintenance (M&R). LARS reveals the conflict: Major Projects often override maintenance windows, degrading the regional availability score which the M&R contractor is penalized for.
  • Conduct Principal Bridge Inspection (CS 450): Mandatory 6-yearly structural inspections defined in DMRB CS 450. Requires significant traffic management planning and often conflicts with network availability targets (KPI: Network Availability).

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSROLE (28 components):
-------------------------------------
  • Board Chair: Currently Dipesh Shah. The primary interface with the DfT Permanent Secretary and Ministers. His role is less about roads and more about ensuring the 'Framework Document' is adhered to. He arbitrates the tension between the CEO's operational reality and the DfT's political aspirations for the SRN.
  • Chief Executive Officer (CEO): Nick Harris. Acts as the Accounting Officer (AO) for National Highways. He has personal liability to Parliament for the proper stewardship of public funds. He sits on the Board but answers to it. His primary headache is balancing the ORR's efficiency KPIs (KP1) against the safety imperatives of GG 104.
  • National Vehicle Recovery Manager (NVRM) Contractor: Outsourced recovery service (e.g., FMG Support) activated when private recovery is failing or dangerous. Statutory removal powers. Trade-off: High cost to NH for activation vs. cost of congestion. Metric: 'Time to Hook' typically <30 mins required by contract.
  • Technical Response Group (TRG): Maintenance contractor teams (e.g., Kier, Amey) deployed for heavy asset interaction: cone laying, barrier repair, fluid spill remediation. Friction: TRG mobilization times (often 60+ mins) frequently blow incident resolution KPIs compared to rapid TO response.
  • National Incident Liaison Officer (NILO): Based at NTOC (Quinton), responsible for strategic oversight of major incidents. They bridge the gap between tactical RCC command and DfT/Ministerial reporting. During debriefs, NILOs enforce the 'National Operating Instructions' against local RCC operational shortcuts.
  • On-Road Traffic Officer (ORTO): Frontline operative role holding specific powers under the Traffic Management Act 2004. Unlike generic 'patrols', this role is strictly governed by 'Concept of Operations' (ConOps) for specific road types (Dynamic Hard Shoulder vs. ALR). Accountability gap: ORTOs are often first-on-scene at fatal incidents, creating high PTSD risk (Occupational Health dependency) and reliance on the 'Trauma Risk Management' (TRiM) process, which is currently under-resourced.
Frontline patrol units operating under the Traffic Management Act 2004.
Unlike police, they lack enforcement powers but are essential for reaching P50 incident clearance targets.
High turnover rates in regions like the South East impact operational capability.
Frontline resource for rolling road blocks and physical closures.
Operational Reality: During severe weather, TO availability drops due to their own travel difficulties, creating a resource gap exactly when demand peaks.
Patrols mandated to clear incidents under the CLEAR initiative.
Operational friction exists with local police forces (CMPG/Met Police) regarding 'Scene Release' timing—Police prioritize forensics/investigation, TOs prioritize 'P50' network availability metrics to meet ORR targets.
Frontline operational role operating under the Traffic Management Act 2004.
Primary user of Airwave radio systems and mobile tablets for incident logging.
Operational friction exists between TO safety protocols (15-minute dwell time limits) and Control Centre pressure to clear carriageways to meet RIS2 availability targets.
Frontline operational role patrolling the SRN.
primary users of the Airwave radio system.
Their operational procedures (Concept of Operations) often conflict with 'Digital Roads' automation ambitions due to reliance on manual dynamic risk assessments under GG 104.
Frontline operational staff.
Their safety relies on the accuracy of MIDAS/SVD alerts.
Currently facing increased risk exposure due to the pause on new Smart Motorways and the retrofit of emergency areas.
Frontline operational role enforcing the Traffic Management Act 2004.
Unlike police, they lack criminal enforcement powers but manage scene safety.
High exposure to live lane risks.
Operationally disconnected from asset delivery teams, leading to reporting gaps on asset condition (e.g., damaged barriers) that don't immediately trigger maintenance workflows.
They rely on Airwave radios (transitioning to ESN) and in-vehicle ruggedized tablets.
There is a disconnect between the data they capture on-scene (via the Pragma app) and what the Control Centre sees in the Command & Control system, leading to data quality issues in post-incident reporting.
Frontline responders.
Their operational protocols (rolling blocks, fending off) are strictly governed by the Traffic Management Act 2004.
There is a disconnect between the digital twin view in the control room (HART) and the physical reality they face (e.g., poor radio coverage in specific blind spots on the M6).
Frontline responders enforcing the Traffic Management Act 2004.
They are the human bridge between 'theoretical' architecture and road reality, physically securing scenes at incidents like the M6 barrier strikes, often waiting hours for Area Contractors to arrive.
The human face of operations.
Their patrol patterns are dictated by 'hotspots' and RCC dispatch.
There is a disconnect here: TOs often arrive at incidents found by Waze users before the RCC has officially verified them via CCTV.
Safety critical under the Traffic Management Act 2004.
The ultimate fallback.
When technology fails, TOs provide physical traffic management.
Resilience Issue: There are not enough TOs to cover a widespread technology outage (e.g., national signal failure).
The boots on the ground.
Statutory powers derived from the Traffic Management Act 2004.
They are the manual backup when technology fails.
There is a disconnect between the architectural view of 'automated incident management' and the reality that a TO patrol is often the only reliable sensor for verifying debris or non-vehicular operational hazards.
The visible front line patrolling the SRN.
Their operational reality is governed by the Traffic Management Act 2004 but constrained by the limitations of the Airwave radio network and the physical dangers of All Lane Running (ALR) sections.
They are the human gap-fill for when Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) fails or false-alarms.
The 'boots on the ground'.
Their role has shifted from traffic management to first-response social care.
They deal with increasing numbers of medical episodes (dementia confusion, heart attacks) due to the ageing demographic, for which they receive only basic medical training.
First responders dispatched to the tunnel portals.
Their safety is the primary constraint on venting strategies (e.g., ensuring fans do not push smoke towards the TOs).
On-road responders.
Their patrol routes are dictated by P50 response time targets.
They are currently caught in the crossfire of the Smart Motorway safety debate, relying on SVD alerts to find stranded vehicles in live lanes.
Patrols tasked with physical scene management.
Conflict: 'Fend-off' positioning guidelines (chapters of the Traffic Officer Manual) often conflict with the physical reality of narrow ALR lanes and lack of hard shoulders.
On-road response capability.
Recent shift to 60mph response speeds (for safety) has increased incident clearance times, negatively impacting the Clearance Index KPI and creating friction with RCC dispatchers.
  • Office of Rail and Road (ORR) Monitor: The independent regulator holding National Highways to account. They are increasingly scrutinizing the 'Efficiency' of renewals, challenging why unit costs for asphalt vary wildly between Area 7 (East Mids) and Area 10 (North West).
The external regulator demanding evidence of efficiency (KPI 1).
They aggressively scrutinize the supply chain for 'gold-plating' versus genuine resilience measures, often conflicting with NH's safety-first (GG 104) mandate.
  • Maintenance & Response (M&R) Community: Regional Tier 1 contractors (e.g., Amey, Kier, Balfour Beatty) executing the Asset Delivery (AD) model. They are operationally squeezed between rigid cyclical requirements and the 'find and fix' reality of reactive drainage issues. Responsible for populating HADDMS via mobile data capture.
  • Structures Inspection Engineer (Tier 1/2 Supply Chain): Certified competencies required (Bridges Inspector Certification Scheme - BICS). The shortage of certified Gold-level inspectors in the UK supply chain creates a bottleneck for delivering the RIS3 inspection volumes, forcing reliance on visual GIs over hands-on PIs.
  • Principal Designer (PD): Statutory role coordinating health and safety in the pre-construction phase. On the Smart Motorway Alliance (SMA), this role struggles to reconcile legacy as-built data (often missing from GDMS) with new ALR design requirements.
  • Principal Contractor (PC): Statutory role planning, managing, and monitoring the construction phase. For the M6 J21a-26 upgrade, the PC is liable for site safety. They control the 'Construction Phase Plan' but often face pressure from NH Operations to minimize lane closures (Chapter 8 traffic management) to maintain network availability.
  • Regional Control Centre (RCC) Operator: Staff based in centres like Godstone or Quinton. High cognitive load monitoring HART and CCTV for incident detection. Sedentary role with significant psychological stress from managing life-or-death incidents remotely.
Frontline operational staff at locations like RCC Godstone and RCC Wakefield.
Currently trained on command-and-control of legacy signals (AMI/MS4).
Lacks competency to interpret probabilistic CAV data feeds or manage 'cooperative' traffic management plans, creating a bottleneck for deploying Connected Corridor use cases.
Based in RCCs (e.g., RCC Godstone, RCC Quinton).
Monitors CCTV, controls MSG4 signals/MIDAS, and coordinates emergency response.
Critical dependency on mental health resilience due to remote exposure to traumatic incidents via visual feeds.
  • Traffic Officer (Business Role): The boots on the ground. Operating under the Traffic Management Act 2004. They deal with the reality of 'smart' motorways when the technology (SVD) fails or when signals aren't set correctly by NTOC.
  • Traffic Officer (On-Road): The boots on the ground. Operational reality is a severe shortage of patrols in Area 4 and Area 7, meaning reliance on technology (SVD/CCTV) is higher than the original Concept of Operations (ConOps) intended.
They are reliant on Airwave radio (legacy) and transition to ESN (Emergency Services Network - delayed).
They are the 'fail-safe' when technology like SVD fails on All Lane Running sections.
Patrol units who are the 'last line of defense' when technology fails.
On ALR sections without hard shoulders, their exposure to live traffic is significantly higher, necessitating the new 'fend-off' vehicle procurement strategy within RIS2.
Patrol units enforcing the 1980 Highways Act.
The physical interface with the public.
Their operational safety is directly compromised when MIDAS loops fail to trigger queue protection signals, forcing reliance on visual confirmation.
Their powers are limited compared to Police (cannot stop speeding vehicles), creating an operational gap.
They are the primary human sensor for the network, often radioing in bridge strikes or debris that the technology missed.
Frontline operational staff (approx.
1,600 FTE) patrolling the network (e.g., M25, M6).
High exposure to traumatic events (fatal collisions), live lane risks, and lone working hazards.
Subject to Safety Critical Medicals.
They often distrust the data from the Control Centre.
If HART says a signal is set to '40', the TO on the M6 might see it blank.
This trust gap leads to TOs relying on voice radio rather than digital dispatch tools, undermining the 'Digital Roads' strategy.
Frontline operational role working on live carriageways (Smart Motorways ALR/ERA environments).
Subject to strict 'Fitness for Task' medical standards (CBH) and high exposure to traumatic events (fatalities/suicides).
Operates under TSRGD compliance.
The frontline resource responding to incidents on the SRN.
Their deployment logic is often in conflict with KPI targets; they are pressured to clear lanes to hit the 'One Hour Rule' for flow, sometimes at the expense of thorough on-scene data capture required for safety analysis.
They are the manual fail-safe when digital systems fail.
Their trust in the Control Room is eroded by frequent false SVD alerts, leading to hesitation in live-lane responses.
Frontline operational staff requiring evolved behavioural skills for conflict resolution and technical skills for Electric Vehicle (EV) incident management (thermal runaway risks), moving beyond simple traffic management.
Frontline operational staff (e.g., operating out of South Mimms or Dartford outstations) responsible for statutory removal of obstructions under the Traffic Management Act 2004.
They operate in a high-risk environment, adhering to GD 904 for high-conspicuity vehicle positioning while balancing pressure from Control Centres to minimize 'Road Period Availability' (RPA) loss.
The boots on the ground enforcing TSRGD compliance and managing incidents.
They are the primary mitigation for the risks associated with All Lane Running (ALR) smart motorways.
Their response times are a critical component of the GG 104 safety case for removing the hard shoulder.
Patrols providing statutory incident management under the Traffic Management Act 2004.
Critical capability: Rolling road blocks and CLEAR initiative implementation.
Performance metric: 1 hour clearance of live lanes.
Frontline responders.
Performance measured against the 10-minute response target (often compromised in rural areas like the A66).
Operational tension exists regarding 'Powers of Removal' vs.
Police primacy at complex crime scenes.
The 'boots on the ground' responding to incidents under the Traffic Management Act 2004.
Operational friction exists here: they are measured on 'Clear Up Time' (CUT) to aid P50 availability, but constrained by strict safety distinctives in DMRB GG 104 that prevent live-lane intervention without police support.
  • Independent Tunnel Safety Officer (TSO): A statutory role that must be functionally independent from the Tunnel Manager (Operations). This creates deliberate organizational friction. The TSO for the A3 Hindhead has the authority to recommend suspension of operations if safety documentation (GG 104) isn't ALARP. In practice, this role often clashes with the 'Keep Traffic Moving' directive during complex maintenance windows.
  • On-Road Traffic Officer: The human reality check for digital failure. When SVD radar throws a false positive or a smart motorway signal sticks, these officers manage the live lane risk. There is significant cultural friction between their operational reality and the 'Digital Roads' utopian rhetoric coming from Bridge House.
Frontline operational role enforcing closure compliance and incident management.
Dependent on inaccurate HART/CHARM signaling data during 'limbo' periods of scheme handover.
The boots on the ground enforcing lane closures and managing incidents.
Their safety relies entirely on the correct functioning of the CHARM system and driver compliance with Red X signals under TSRGD.
Patrol units responsible for clearing incidents, managing traffic, and supporting road users, requiring constant connectivity via TORS and mobile data terminals.
  • On-Road Traffic Officer Service (East Region): Frontline operational response units. Statutory powers under Traffic Management Act 2004. Currently facing resource constraints covering A14/A428 works while maintaining response times to P1 incidents.
On-road responders for A428 and M11.
Safety critical role acting under the Traffic Management Act 2004.
Reliance on Airwave radio (transitioning to ESN) creates communication gaps in topographic low points.
Frustrated by delayed updates from RCC.
  • ITS Systems Assurance Engineer: Scarce role responsible for validating safety-critical software updates under DMRB GG 104 requirements. Current headcount is insufficient to handle the velocity of software changes required for V2X integration on the Lower Thames Crossing, leading to reliance on external consultants and loss of intelligent client capability.
  • National Traffic Operations Centre (NTOC) Operator: The frontline role managing real-time operational risk. They execute the 'Response' phase of the risk framework, setting signals on the NTIS system. Their workload is a risk factor itself; operator fatigue leads to delayed signal setting during incidents on the M1.
  • Compliance Officer (Oversight & Compliance): Functions like Safety, Engineering & Standards (SES) and Net Zero that set frameworks (DMRB, GG 104) and monitor compliance. A critical architectural tension exists here: the Second Line often lacks the capacity to physically inspect all First Line assets, relying heavily on self-certification by project teams.
  • Senior Responsible Owner (SRO): The single point of accountability for a major scheme (e.g., A428 Black Cat). In reality, this role faces a massive tension: they are accountable for delivery under the OSM (Operational Scheme Manual) but often lack direct line management control over the matrixed technical assurance teams (SES) required to sign off the design, creating a critical bottleneck in the governance flow.
  • Traffic Officer Service (TOS): On-road operational resource responding to incidents; their safety is the primary driver for 'Red X' compliance enforcement; currently facing morale issues due to the increased risk profile of ALR (Smart Motorways) without hard shoulders.
  • First Line of Defence (Operational Risk Ownership): Operational management within Operations and Major Projects directorates who own and manage risks day-to-day. They are responsible for implementing controls (e.g., traffic management via RCCs) and delivering schemes (e.g., A428, A66) in line with DMRB standards. In reality, delivery pressure often conflicts with assurance processes here.
  • RCC Traffic Assessment Officer (TAO): Operational staff within the Control Room (e.g., RCC West Midlands) responsible for monitoring MIDAS alerts and CCTV. They utilise HART's incident management interface to set 'Red X' closures for stopped vehicles in ALR (All Lane Running) sections. Their workflow is heavily scrutinised following the ORR 'Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake', placing immense pressure on HART's UI responsiveness during high-stress incidents.
  • Delivery Integration Partner (DIP): Tier 1 contractors (e.g., Balfour Beatty, Galliford Try) appointed under RDP. They hold the risk for design and construction but rely heavily on a transient Tier 2/3 supply chain, often creating a visibility gap regarding quality assurance and modern slavery compliance.
  • On-Road Traffic Officer Service (TOS): Frontline operational response. Role has shifted significantly from 'traffic management' to 'incident safety' following the removal of hard shoulders on ALR (All Lane Running) schemes. Primary users of the Airwave radio network.
Uniformed officers with statutory powers under the Traffic Management Act 2004 to stop traffic, close lanes, and manage incidents on the SRN to protect the scene and restore capacity.
  • Maintenance and Response Contractor: Supply chain partners (Asset Delivery Community) contracted to execute physical works, including cyclic maintenance, winter service, and defect repair, operating under the Asset Delivery model.
  • Road Safety Audit Team: Independent team responsible for conducting Stage 1-4 Road Safety Audits (RSA) in accordance with GG 119, ensuring distinct separation from the design team.

ARCHIMATE:BUSINESSSERVICE (78 components):
----------------------------------------
  • National Traffic Data Publication Service: The external dissemination of SRN status via DATEX II v3 feeds. Critical for meeting the 'Open Data' requirements of the DfT Protocol. Consumers include Google Maps, Waze, and logistics firms. Operational issue: There is a latency gap between an incident being verified by a Traffic Officer (Airwave radio) and that status appearing in the DATEX feed, often leading to Waze showing a closure before the official NH feed does.
  • Project Rapid (EV Charging Infrastructure): The £950m Rapid Charging Fund initiative to upgrade Motorway Service Areas (MSAs). Architectural constraint: National Highways does not own the MSAs (Moto, Welcome Break, etc.) nor the DNO grid connections. We are effectively funding assets we don't control, creating a governance void where we cannot enforce uptime reliability (99% availability) on the chargers despite public perception that it's 'our' responsibility.
  • Statutory Incident Information Publication: The legal obligation under the Highways Act 1980 and license conditions to inform the public of network availability. This service distinguishes 'verified' NH data from 'crowdsourced' Waze data. Performance is measured against KPI: Time to Inform (TTI) via VMS and Digital Channels.
  • Tunnel Incident Response Service: Delivered by dedicated Traffic Officers and local tunnel safety teams. Success metric: 'Time to Clear'. heavily dependent on the reliability of the PA/VA (Public Address/Voice Alarm) systems to instruct drivers to evacuate. If the technology fails, this service collapses, leading to potential loss of life.
  • NSIP Development Consent Order (DCO) Management: The critical path service for securing planning approval for major schemes like the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine and Lower Thames Crossing. This involves navigating the Planning Inspectorate process, managing Section 42 consultations, and mitigating Judicial Review risks. This service frequently clashes with engineering delivery teams who push for design flexibility after the 'Red Line Boundary' has been legally fixed.
  • Red Claims Recovery (Crown Property Damage): The revenue-generating legal service that chases insurers of drivers who damage SRN assets (barriers, bridges, gantries). There is a persistent operational conflict here: Traffic Officers (TOS) prioritize 'Clearance in 15 mins' (opening the road) to support P50 availability metrics, often destroying the forensic evidence Legal needs to pursue the claim.
  • Total Facilities Management (TFM) Contract: Outsourced provision of Hard FM (M&E maintenance) and Soft FM (security, cleaning). The friction point: SLA-driven maintenance often lags behind the immediate 'fix-on-fail' requirements of a live 24/7 control room environment, requiring escalation to Gold Command during failures.
  • Trauma Risk Management (TRiM): Peer-delivered mental health support system activated after 'Business Critical' incidents (e.g., multi-fatality collisions, suicides). Essential for maintaining staff availability in RCCs and Outstations post-incident.
  • Strategic Roads User Survey (SRUS) Management: The service managing the interface with Transport Focus to track driver satisfaction. The metrics derived here (journey time, safety perception, information quality) directly influence the RIS3 performance specification. There is a disconnect here where poor asset condition (potholes/LARS data) drives down satisfaction despite successful major scheme delivery.
  • Safety Critical Medical Screening: Mandatory 'Fitness for Task' occupational health checks (eyesight, cardiovascular, diabetes) for Traffic Officers. Failure results in immediate removal from driving duties, impacting regional shift coverage and LARS (Lane Availability) response times.
  • Lone Worker Monitoring Service: Technology-enabled welfare check for Inspectors and TOs operating remotely (e.g., inspecting drainage assets off-network). Relies on GPS devices/apps; failure creates unmitigated safety risk in remote areas like A66 Northern Trans-Pennine.
  • Strategic Road Network (SRN) Capacity Provision: The core service mandated by the Licence. Delivery is tensioned against the 'Safety First' imperative. Measured by Lane Availability Reporting System (LARS) but constantly degraded by Major Project interventions (e.g., A428, A66 construction).
  • SRN Open Data Integration Service (MaaS Enabler): Provides real-time traffic flow, incident, and roadwork data to third-party Mobility as a Service (MaaS) aggregators (Citymapper, Google, Logistics UK). Relies heavily on the National Traffic Information Service (NTIS) cloud migration. Critical friction point: Data granularity losses at the interface between SRN (Highways) and Local Road Networks (Local Authorities), often causing 'blind spots' in end-to-end journey planning.
  • Connected & Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) Infrastructure Readiness: Service capability to support Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD). Focuses on physical and digital infrastructure certification for Level 3/4 autonomy. Heavily constrained by the 'Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake' safety criteria. Currently piloting on the A2/M2 Connected Corridor, but national rollout is stalled by funding tensions between RIS3 digital enhancements and basic asset renewal needs.
  • Autonomous Freight Corridor Optimization (Logistics): A specialized service prioritizing heavy freight platooning and autonomous logistics flow, specifically targeting the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine and A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon corridors. Aims to smooth flow to reduce braking/emissions. Trade-off: Requires reserving dynamic capacity (virtual lanes) which conflicts with general traffic capacity KPIs (P50 journey times) during peak hours.
  • SRN Dynamic Asset Monetisation (IaaS): Future capability to charge for specific infrastructure usage (e.g., dynamic tolling for premium express lanes or EV charging slot reservation). Currently technically feasible via free-flow charging (like Dart Charge), but politically toxic. Architecturally limited by the legacy interfaces in the payment processing systems and strict Treasury constraints on hypothecated funding.
  • Independent Assurance Service (TAS): Provided by Safety, Engineering and Standards (SES) directorate. They act as the internal regulator. There is a structural conflict here: The Major Projects directorate (Delivery) wants speed; SES (Assurance) wants absolute adherence to DMRB standards like CD 123 (Geometric design). Disputes here often escalate to the Chief Engineer.

ARCHIMATE:CONSTRAINT (63 components):
-----------------------------------
  • Smart Motorway Evidence Stocktake (2020) & Written Ministerial Statement: A hard political constraint that paused the rollout of All Lane Running (ALR) schemes. It overrides previous architectural roadmaps and forces a retrofit of Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) radar to existing schemes (M1, M6), diverting funds from planned RIS2 enhancements.
  • Highways Act 1980 Section 41 (Duty to Maintain): The absolute statutory floor. Section 41 imposes a duty to maintain the highway at public expense. This is not optional. Failure here leads to direct legal liability for National Highways. This forces Operations to prioritise reactive patching (potholes) over strategic asset management when OpEx is tight, creating a 'fix on fail' culture despite asset management rhetoric.
  • Infrastructure Act 2015 Part 4 (RIS Implementation): Establishes the Road Investment Strategy (RIS) legal framework. It separates NH (License Holder) from DfT (Shareholder). While intended to provide 5-year funding certainty, it creates a rigid capital cycle (RIS2/RIS3) that often conflicts with the fluid reality of asset degradation and inflationary pressures on schemes like the A66.
  • DfT Framework Document: The foundational governance contract that dictates what the Board can and cannot do. It specifically limits the Board's borrowing powers and mandates compliance with the Green Book for investment appraisals. It creates a rigid dependency loop where NH cannot deviate from agreed RIS outcomes without lengthy DfT Change Control.
  • DMRB GG 104 (Safety Risk Assessment): The overarching safety standard. Every change to TOS operations (e.g., single crewing trials) must demonstrate 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) risk profiles under GG 104. This standard is currently the primary blocker to operational cost-saving initiatives, as proving safety neutrality on ALR sections is statistically difficult.
The 'Bible' for safety governance.
Any deviation from standard on A428 or A66 requires a GG 104 assessment.
Post-Smart Motorway stocktake, the bar for 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) has effectively been raised to 'Eliminate Risk' by the ORR.
The 'Safety Bible'.
This is not a guideline; it is the statutory safety governance standard.
Every major project must produce a GG 104 compliant Safety Risk Assessment.
This defines the safety baseline.
Currently, there is significant friction applying GG 104 to 'Digital Roads' initiatives where software failure modes are not adequately covered by traditional civil engineering hazard logs.
The 'Safety Bible' for the Strategic Road Network (SRN).
Mandates the ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) approach.
Currently the primary friction point for Smart Motorway (ALR) retrofits, as proving safety equivalency against hard shoulder baselines requires complex data evidence from SVD (Stopped Vehicle Detection) systems.
The governing standard for safety risk on the SRN.
This is the 'governor' on the speed of HART deployment.
Every migration from NRTS to HART requires a GG 104 safety assessment to prove that the change in transmission technology does not increase the risk of a fatality (FSI) on smart motorways.
The governing standard for safety risk.
Any change to the SCADA code (even a patch) requires a full GG 104 assessment, slowing down the software update cycle from 'Agile' sprints to 6-month waterfall releases.
The absolute governing standard for safety risk on the SRN.
No scheme, digital or physical, goes live without a GG 104 safety case.
The tension: GG 104 is deterministic and struggles to quantify the stochastic behavior of AI/Machine Learning in CAVs.
We are effectively forcing probabilistic AI risk into a deterministic engineering box.
Requires ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) demonstration for any operational change or departure from standard.
Strict adherence to GG 104 is currently slowing down digital innovation pilots as safety cases for non-standard AI traffic detection take 12-18 months to approve.
The primary safety governance standard.
Any CAV trial (e.g., platooning) requires a rigorous GG 104 safety case.
This creates operational friction as 'agile' digital teams struggle with the deterministic safety evidence required by the Safety Engineering & Standards (SES) directorate.
  • RIS2/RIS3 Budget Envelope: The fixed 5-year funding settlement from DfT. Inflation (construction materials index) has eroded real purchasing power, forcing a trade-off: cancelling 'desirable' preventative works to fund 'essential' safety-critical renewals, contradicting the whole-life cost efficiency mandate.
  • Performance Specification (P50): The metric requiring 98% of lanes to be available. This creates a perverse incentive to patch-repair (potholes) rather than perform deep structural renewals, as full renewals require longer possession times that hurt the P50 score.
  • DMRB CS 450 Inspection of Highway Structures: Mandates the cycle of General and Principal Inspections (6-yearly). Compliance here is non-negotiable for safety, but the output (General Inspection Reports) often sits in a backlog because there isn't enough Opex budget to fix the 'Category 2' defects identified, creating a liability paper trail.
DMRB standard mandating the frequency and method of structural inspections to ensure the safety of bridges, gantries, and retaining walls.
  • DMRB CS 228 Skidding Resistance: Standard defining the Investigatory Levels (IL) for skid resistance. This standard forces immediate intervention if SCRIM coefficients drop below threshold, overriding planned capital works and disrupting the 5-year forward programme. A primary driver for emergency resurfacing.
The standard mandating friction levels.
Failure to meet this triggers immediate SCRIM/SCANNER alerts.
Often forces emergency resurfacing that Operations hates because it disrupts flow on strategic corridors.
Mandatory Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) standard governing the management of skidding resistance on the SRN.
It dictates investigatory levels for friction based on site categories (e.g., approaches to junctions, free-flow motorways).
  • Asset Data Management Manual (ADMM) v2.2: The mandatory standard defining data requirements for SRN assets. Specifies attributes for Pavement (HAPMS), Structures (SMIS), and Geotech (GDMS). Often treated as a 'tick-box' exercise by Major Projects supply chains, leading to data gaps at PCF Stage 6 (Construction end). Governance sits with SES (Safety, Engineering & Standards).
The rigid data dictionary that defines how National Highways classifies assets (from gantry foundations to drainage nodes).
This creates a massive architectural tension: modern BIM models use IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) or Uniclass 2015, but ADMM requires specific internal codes for ingestion into IAM IS.
This translation layer is where 30-40% of data fidelity is lost during handover.
The data standard governing asset attributes.
Frequently bypassed by supply chain contractors in the rush to meet 'Open for Traffic' deadlines, resulting in 'digital debt' for Asset Management.
  • Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2) Capital Envelope: The £27.4bn funding constraint (2020-2025) which is currently over-subscribed due to construction inflation. This creates a hard tension: funds must be diverted from 'Renewal of Roads' (Opex/Capex mix) to plug gaps in flagship Enhancement schemes like the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine, starving the asset base of necessary maintenance.
  • Constraint: Implied element created to satisfy AI-discovered relationship
  • DMRB CS 551 (Testing and inspection of drainage systems): Specifies the inspection frequency and testing standards. Creates a heavy resource burden on Operations Directorate to validate asset condition, often leading to a backlog of required CCTV surveys which constrains accurate investment modelling.
  • Smart Motorway Stocktake (2020) & Pause (2022): DfT mandated pause on new ALR schemes until 5 years of safety data is available. Forces MPD to pivot resources from new builds (M3 J9) to maintenance and safety retrofits.
Government mandate halting new ALR schemes.
This has stranded capital assets (gantries, barriers) on paused schemes like the M3 J9-14, forcing a complex architectural pivot to retrofit existing ALR capacity with additional emergency areas (ERAs) rather than delivering new capacity.
Government instruction halting new ALR schemes.
This stranded millions in sunk costs for architecture designed for Smart Motorways (e.g., specific cabling infrastructure on the M3) that now must support a 'Dynamic Hard Shoulder' or traditional layout, leaving architectural 'orphans' in the roadside cabinet network.
  • ORR Safety Reporting Requirements: Office of Road and Rail mandate to report on SVD performance (detection rates/time). If targets aren't met, ALR sections face potential closure or speed reduction.
  • Fixed Capex Funding Envelope: Hard budgetary ceiling for schemes like A66 Northern Trans-Pennine. Breaching this requires extensive internal governance (Investment Committee) and DfT approval, creating immense pressure to cut costs via material changes.
  • Government Pause on New Smart Motorways: DfT directive halting the rollout of new ALR schemes (removed from RIS2/3) until 5 years of safety data is available. This has orphaned several sunk costs in design and requires architectural rework of schemes like the M6 J21a-26 to revert to Dynamic Hard Shoulder or traditional widening.
DfT directive halting the roll-out of new All Lane Running schemes (e.g., M3 J9-14) until 5 years of safety data is gathered.
This has stranded capital investment and forced a shift to 'Retrofit ERA' programmes on existing RIS2 operational routes.
  • Smart Motorway Stocktake (2020/2022): The government response to Transport Committee recommendations effectively pausing All Lane Running (ALR) rollouts. This architectural constraint invalidates many historical Route Strategy options that relied on 'Cheap Capacity' via ALR, forcing a return to expensive widening or demand management.
  • PAS 2080:2023 Carbon Management in Infrastructure: The governing standard for managing whole-life carbon. While formally adopted, operational adherence varies. Major Projects (MP) apply it rigorously for DCO consent (e.g., Lower Thames Crossing), but smaller Operations (Ops) renewal schemes often bypass deep carbon analysis due to the 'constraints of existing alignment' loophole and the urgency of P1/P2 defect repairs.
The mandatory standard for carbon management capability.
We are certified, but the reality is a constant battle to force Tier 1 contractors on schemes like A66 Northern Trans-Pennine to move beyond 'tick-box' compliance to actual carbon engineering.
Requires explicit carbon baselining before Preliminary Design.
The global standard for managing carbon, adopted by NH.
It forces a 'whole life carbon' assessment.
The tension lies in the fact that while we certify against this, the actual supply chain (Tier 1 contractors on RIS schemes) struggles to provide granular data, making our carbon reporting largely estimated rather than measured.
  • DMRB Standards Rigidity (CD 123 / GG 101): Geometric Design (CD 123) and General Principles (GG 101) standards. These codify physical infrastructure requirements that often conflict with digital-first solutions (e.g., reducing physical gantries in favor of in-vehicle signaling), forcing hybrid costs without full benefits.
  • Planning Act 2008: Primary legislation. Imposes rigid 6-month examination limit which pressures NH teams to respond to 'Written Questions' within extremely tight deadlines (Deadlines 1-8).
The primary legislation governing NSIPs.
Sets the rigid statutory timelines that constrain National Highways' ability to iterate design once submitted.
Forces 'front-loading' of design work.
Legislation that mandates the use of Development Consent Orders (DCO) for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) on the Strategic Road Network.
  • RIS2 Efficiency KPI (KPI4): Regulatory requirement to deliver £2.23bn efficiency savings. This creates a perverse incentive to defer Opex maintenance (Renewal of Roads) in favour of Capex capitalisation, leading to a degradation in long-term asset condition (skid resistance and pavement serviceability).
  • Carbon Budget & Net Zero 2050: Limits road capacity expansion in the RIS3 portfolio.
Legal constraint stopping road capacity expansion.
The Transport Decarbonisation Plan is forcing RIS3 to focus on 'Digital Roads' and EV charging infrastructure (Project Rapid) rather than widening tarmac.
  • DMRB GG 104 Requirements for Safety Risk Assessment: The 'Holy Grail' of safety governance. Mandates As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) justification. Used by Safety Engineering to block architectural changes that introduce unquantified operational risk, often stalling digital innovation pilots.
The safety governance standard mandating safety risk characterisation (Classes A-D).
It is the primary blockage point for Stage 3 (Construction) gateways; if the GG 104 safety plan is rejected by the Safety, Engineering & Standards (SES) division, the scheme cannot proceed to site, regardless of commercial pressures.
The 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) standard.
The weapon of choice for the ORR when investigating Smart Motorway incidents.
Operational tension: RCCs often hesitate to activate hard shoulder running (dynamic schemes) due to GG 104 liability fears if sweep protocols aren't perfect.
The 'Holy Scripture' of safety governance.
Every deviation from standard (Departures from Standards) in Smart Motorway retrofit or tunnel operations must pass a GG 104 assessment.
In practice, the interpretation of 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) creates massive friction between the Safety Engineering & Standards (SES) directorate and Major Projects delivery teams who just want to pour concrete.
The overarching safety standard.
Used to justify funding for 'Safety Critical' assets (barriers, lighting) over 'Asset Condition' works.
If a scheme is tagged GG 104, it bypasses standard Value Management cuts, leading to teams 'gold-plating' schemes with safety justifications to secure funding.
The governing standard for safety risk.
It forces trade-offs: the M5 Oldbury scheme costs escalated significantly because GG 104 ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) calculations mandated more extensive temporary works than originally budgeted.
The 'Safety Case' standard.
No scheme opens without a GG 104 compliant safety risk assessment.
The tension: Retrofitting legacy smart motorways to meet modern GG 104 ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) standards is proving cost-prohibitive.
The safety standard used as the final backstop against excessive value engineering.
Requires 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) justification, though 'Reasonably Practicable' is often interpreted heavily through a cost lens.
The safety standard that governs our ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) arguments.
We are using this to argue that cutting the RIS3 renewals budget is a breach of safety safety standards, effectively forcing the DfT's hand on funding.
Restricts ability to defer maintenance.
If BCI drops below critical thresholds, GG 104 mandates intervention, overriding financial preference for new schemes.
The 'Holy Grail' of NH standards.
It creates a perverse incentive against decarbonisation.
Example: Concrete Step Barriers (CSB) are mandated for median safety (preventing crossovers), but represent a huge embodied carbon load compared to steel.
Safety (GG 104) almost always trumps Carbon (GG 103) in the architectural governance boards, limiting radical material substitution.
The absolute governing standard for the technical evaluation.
Proposals that suggest 'Departures from Standards' to save costs without a robust GG 104 safety risk characterization are automatically rejected, overriding any commercial savings.
The safety 'bible'.
Suppliers cannot change a design or traffic management plan without a GG 104 assessment.
This is the primary bottleneck in approval workflows for scheme deviations.
Misinterpretation of GG 104 by supply chain designers causes significant rework loops.
The 'Bible' for safety governance.
Mandates the 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) standard.
Every deviation from standard (e.g., narrow lanes at A428 Black Cat) requires a GG 104 assessment.
Often weaponized to halt value engineering attempts that compromise safety margins.
The holy grail of safety governance.
Every change to the SRN architecture, from a new Smart Motorway section to a software patch in COBS, must pass a GG 104 safety risk assessment.
This standard often slows down agile digital transformation initiatives due to its rigorous evidence requirements.
The governing standard for safety governance.

The 'Constitution' of safety governance.
Mandates that any change to the SRN (like removing hard shoulders) must demonstrate risks are As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP).
Used by the Chief Highway Engineer to block or modify schemes that trade safety for capacity, specifically impacting the Smart Motorway retrofit programme.
The 'Bible' of safety governance.

Architectural friction occurs here when delivery teams treat GG 104 as a tick-box exercise rather than a dynamic risk management tool during scheme delivery.
Dictates that any change to the SRN (Smart Motorways, new schemes like A66) must demonstrate risks are 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP).
Operational reality: Interpretation of GG 104 is the primary bottleneck for the 'Stopped Vehicle Detection' (SVD) retrofit programme, often halting delivery when statistical safety evidence is ambiguous.
It mandates that any change to the SRN must be 'Better or No Worse' than the existing state.
This standard is currently the primary friction point for the Smart Motorway pause, as proving 'No Worse' for ALR without hard shoulders has become statistically contentious.
Any 'Digital Twin' decision-support algorithm must demonstrate safety compliance equivalent to human operators.
This is the primary blocker for automating responses to Smart Motorway incidents.
The safety standard that trumps all performance targets.
It allows Regional Directors to override 'Availability' targets if a safety case (e.g., Stopped Vehicle Detection failure) is proven, creating a loophole in the performance regime.

Requires 'So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable' (SFAIRP) analysis.
This standard is currently the primary blocker for new technology rollout, as proving safety equivalence to legacy systems is statistically difficult.
The 'Iron Law' of safety governance.
Requires ALR schemes to demonstrate safety performance 'better than or equal to' conventional motorways.
This standard is currently the primary bottleneck for signing off new operational technology innovations due to rigorous evidence requirements.
The primary governance standard for safety risk.
Often weaponised during scheme delivery to halt 'value engineering' attempts that compromise safety margins.
Requires the 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) demonstration for non-compliant geometry.
Every deviation from standard (Departures) on schemes like the A428 or A66 must pass a GG 104 assessment.
This standard is currently the primary bottleneck in digital innovation; if a new AI traffic tool cannot be deterministically proven safe under GG 104, it doesn't touch the live road.
The primary safety standard governing changes to the SRN.
Acts as a significant architectural brake on CAV rollout; the 'Safety Case' for autonomous interaction with live traffic often fails to meet the ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) threshold without proven statistical evidence.
Any deviation from standard operating procedures (e.g., trial of new CAV sensors) requires a rigorous GG 104 assessment.
Often cited as the primary blocker for agile innovation deployment.
The absolute bible for safety governance.
We cannot enable Connected Corridor features on the A2/M2 or Lower Thames Crossing unless the Safety Case proves the ALKS handover protocol meets the 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) standard defined here.
This creates massive friction with agile digital delivery teams.
Every deviation from standard design (like the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine variances or Smart Motorway retrofits) requires a GG 104 assessment.
It is the primary bottleneck in engineering sign-off, often weaponized to halt value-engineering proposals that compromise safety margins.
The 'License to Operate' standard.
Every deviation from standard geometry (CD 123) or technology failure on Smart Motorways triggers a GG 104 assessment.
The tension here is immense: operations often run on 'Accepted' risk levels that Project Delivery teams would never sign off on.
The absolute gatekeeper standard for introducing AMoD or AI-driven traffic management on the SRN.
Every new mobility service must demonstrate ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) safety risk.
This standard is currently the biggest friction point for rapid innovation, as proving safety cases for probabilistic AI decision-making against GG 104 determinism is architecturally complex.

Every operational technology innovation (AI incident detection, V2X) hits the wall of GG 104.
We cannot deploy autonomous traffic management without a rigorous safety case proving the risk is 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP).
This standard is the primary throttle on the speed of digital adoption.

It's currently a bottleneck because we don't have enough competent safety engineers to process the volume of assessments required for the legacy concrete roads program.
DMRB standard mandating ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) justification.
Currently creates significant friction; keeping the tunnel open with obsolete fire detection requires a rigorous, often contested safety case that balances statutory duties against the catastrophic risk of fire in a live tunnel.
The primary DMRB standard governing safety governance.
Every architectural decision, from SVD implementation to A428 geometric alignment, must pass a GG 104 assessment.
Often weaponised to block digital innovations that cannot mathematically prove 'better than existing' safety cases.
The DMRB standard governing safety risk.
The primary blocker for automated responses.
We cannot yet prove that an AI-driven V2X instruction to 'Slow Down' is as safe as a human operator setting a sign via NTOC.
The safety case is stuck in 'Generic Product' phase.
Suppliers often struggle to align their proprietary risk tools with GG 104's specific safety risk characterisation, leading to assurance delays at the Technical Assurance Board (TAB).
Governs the safety case for any changes introduced by the supply chain.
This is the 'hard gate' that often halts innovation trials from the supply chain because the bureaucratic burden of proof is too high for SMEs.
The 'Generic Governance' standard that dictates As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) logic.
The weaponisation of this standard by internal safety governance often freezes operational changes due to the difficulty in quantifying safety deltas for new digital interventions.
The overarching safety standard requiring 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) demonstration.
Heavily influences the design approval of the A303 Stonehenge and A428 schemes.
DMRB standard providing the framework for identifying hazards and assessing risks in civil engineering and maintenance activities.
DMRB standard defining the 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) framework and safety risk governance for all changes to the SRN, critical for Smart Motorway safety cases.
  • TSRGD (Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions) 2016: The rigid legal framework that prevents NH from simply adopting international innovation. For example, while Rijkswaterstaat uses specific red-X signalling, NH cannot deploy identical solutions without DfT legislative changes, creating a 'digital lag' between international best practice and UK implementation.
Legal statutory instrument dictating what can be shown on a VMS.
Strictly limits the 'free text' messages RCCs can set, often preventing specific, helpful driver information during unique incidents.
Statutory legal constraint.
Dictates exactly what can be displayed on a VMS (Variable Message Sign).
It severely limits the ability of the Digital Roads team to innovate with new driver information formats without seeking DfT authorization.
Legal constraint.
Strictly limits what messages can be displayed on VMS.
Prevents NTIS from displaying 'informal' routing advice or specific commercial brand names during major incidents.
This regulatory rigidity clashes with the flexible messaging capabilities of modern VMS hardware.
Statutory instrument.
It dictates exactly what we can display on Variable Message Signs (VMS).
It limits our ability to innovate with new driver information messages without DfT authorization.
Statutory instrument defining the legal status of the Red X.
If our architectural systems (NTIS/HART) cannot log the exact time a sign was lit, police cannot prosecute non-compliance, undermining the safety case for ALR.
  • Construction Design and Management (CDM) Regulations 2015: Statutory instrument mandating health and safety management in construction. For National Highways, this is not just compliance; it dictates the legal liability structure for NSIPs (e.g., Lower Thames Crossing) and regional renewals. Failure here triggers HSE intervention and ORR regulatory escalation.
  • Supply Chain Health Data GDPR Barriers: Legal barrier preventing National Highways from directly accessing granular health data of Tier 2/3 contractors working on schemes like the M6 J21a-26 Smart Motorway upgrade.
  • Development Consent Order (DCO): Legal planning instrument. Once sealed for schemes like LTC, it freezes scope. Any innovation or operational change post-DCO requires heavy legal lifting, discouraging agility.
  • Public Contracts Regulations (PCR) 2015: Statutory instrument dictating procurement procedures. Limits the ability to directly award work to performing contractors without re-tendering, often delaying remedial works.
The statutory framework governing NH procurement.
Strict adherence often slows down the 'agility' requested by Digital Roads initiatives, creating a trade-off between speed of innovation (e.g., trialling new roadside technology) and legal compliance risk.
  • Environment Act 2021 (BNG Mandate): Statutory requirement forcing minimum 10% Biodiversity Net Gain on all NSIPs (e.g., Lower Thames Crossing, A66) and Town & Country Planning Act consents. Creates a 'hard constraint' on Red Line Boundaries—if the Defra Metric 4.0 calculation is negative, the DCO application is at significant risk of rejection by the Planning Inspectorate.
  • ORR Safety & Performance Monitor Mandate: Statutory oversight from the Office of Rail and Road. They actively monitor the 'Smart Motorways Stocktake' delivery. If NH fails to meet availability metrics or SVD performance targets, the ORR can intervene, altering capital allocation priorities away from enhancements toward renewals.
  • The Road Tunnel Safety Regulations 2007 (Retained EU Law): The absolute statutory baseline for SRN tunnel operations, deriving from the EU Directive 2004/54/EC. It designates the Administrative Authority (DfT) and mandates the appointments of Tunnel Managers and Safety Officers. Non-compliance here isn't a KPI failure; it's a legal breach. This constrains every decision made at RCC Godstone regarding the A3 Hindhead or the A282 Dartford Crossing.
  • Vienna Convention on Road Traffic (1968): International treaty requirement that a driver must be in control of the vehicle at all times. The primary legal barrier to Level 3+ autonomy. UK derogation is required to allow 'hands-off' operation, creating a friction point between vehicle capability and legal road use.
  • Road Tunnel Safety Regulations 2007: Statutory instrument implementing the EU Directive on tunnel safety. Non-compliance carries criminal liability for the Tunnel Manager, overriding any corporate efficiency targets.
  • DMRB CD 352 Design of Road Tunnels: The governing standard for tunnel safety systems. Strict requirements for ventilation and fire suppression. Operational friction: Retrofitting CD 352 compliance onto aging assets like the A282 Dartford tunnels is technically nearly impossible without total reconstruction, forcing reliance on 'ALARP' (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) risk arguments via GG 104 assessments.
Current design standard.
Impossible to retrofit to assets like Blackwall or Dartford West without total reconstruction.
Creates a permanent 'Departures from Standard' administrative burden for asset engineers.
Standard mandating safety systems and ventilation requirements.
Rigid adherence often conflicts with the practicalities of retrofitting legacy assets like the Dartford Crossing, requiring complex Departures from Standards.
The DMRB standard governing tunnel safety.
Currently creating friction for the A303 Stonehenge scheme where heritage constraints conflict with standard emergency exit spacing requirements.
Strict prescriptive standard defining tunnel safety systems.
Clashes with legacy infrastructure in older tunnels (like Dartford), creating 'departures from standard' paperwork nightmares.
  • UNECE Regulation 157 (ALKS): Automated Lane Keeping System regulation. This creates a massive operational headache for our Traffic Officers and NTOC, as it legally defines when a 'driver' is not driving. We currently lack the real-time telemetry to know if a vehicle involved in an incident on the M1 or M25 was in ALKS mode, complicating liability and clearance under the Traffic Management Act 2004.
Automated Lane Keeping System technical regulation.
Limits initial automated driving to 37mph (later 80mph) on motorways without pedestrians.
NH must certify specific SRN sections as 'ODD-compliant' (Operational Design Domain) for this regulation to apply.
  • DMRB GG 104: Requirements for safety risk assessment. The holy grail of NH engineering governance. The tension here is extreme: trying to apply GG 104's deterministic 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) logic to the probabilistic, non-deterministic nature of AI-driven CAVs defined in ISO 21448. This mismatch stalls safety cases for trials.
The absolute gatekeeper for any CAV trial on the SRN.
The rigorous ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) requirements for unproven autonomous software create significant project delays, often conflicting with agile development cycles of CAV partners.
  • NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) Profile B: Mandatory security standard for Critical National Infrastructure. The friction point is 'Data Process Security'—legacy roadside technology was never designed to meet modern encryption standards, forcing expensive retrofits or risk acceptance waivers that the DfT is increasingly reluctant to sign off.
Mandatory compliance framework for Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).
National Highways must demonstrate 'Manage', 'Protect', 'Detect', and 'Minimize' capabilities.
Creates significant tension with legacy Operational Technology (OT) assets (e.g., specific tunnel SCADA systems dating back to 2005) which cannot meet modern encryption or logging standards without total replacement.
  • Civil Service Pay Band Structure: HR constraint preventing National Highways from offering market-rate salaries for Data Scientists and V2X Cyber Security specialists, who command 40-60% higher wages in the private sector. This forces a heavy reliance on the TSSP (Technical Specialist and Surveyor Framework) supply chain, hollowing out institutional memory.
Government-mandated salary bands and FTE caps that create severe friction in recruiting Data Architects and Cyber Security specialists, forcing National Highways to rely on expensive contingent labour (contractors) for critical systems like HART and NTIS.
  • Managing Public Money (MPM): HMT's statutory framework. It strictly prohibits cross-subsidisation between financial years ('annuality') and between Capital and Resource budgets. This forces a 'use it or lose it' mentality in Q4, often leading to inefficient, rushed spending on minor works just to balance the books.
  • Net Zero Carbon 2030 (Corporate Estate): Mandatory decarbonization target for NH's own estate (Scope 1 & 2). Forces capital trade-offs: funding diverted from operational capacity upgrades to retrofitting heat pumps and LED lighting at depots like Bescot and motorway service areas.
  • NIS Directive & CNI Security Segmentation: Statutory obligation to protect Critical National Infrastructure. This creates a friction point for the Digital Workplace programme, effectively preventing a 'single pane of glass' view for Traffic Officers who have to use separate terminals for corporate email (O365) and command and control (HART). We are trading user experience for national security.
  • Section 43 (Commercial Interests) Exemption: The primary shield used to redact procurement data for the Lower Thames Crossing and A303 Stonehenge. While necessary to protect negotiation positions with Tier 1 contractors, it creates significant friction with transparency groups and leads to frequent ICO appeals.
  • HMT Green Book (Five Case Model): Mandates Strategic, Economic, Commercial, Financial, and Management cases. The 'Optimism Bias' adjustment required here is the primary reason the A66 budget looks insufficient before ground is even broken.
  • RIS2 Funding Envelope: The fixed 5-year budget settlement from DfT; currently oversubscribed due to inflation, forcing the IPC to make trade-offs between enhancement schemes (A66) and maintenance (Renewals).
  • ORR Safety & Performance Targets: Regulatory constraints from the Office of Rail and Road. Includes targets for KSI (Killed or Seriously Injured) reduction and Network Availability. Failure to meet these triggers heavy scrutiny and potential fines. This drives a risk-averse culture where innovation (like removing hard shoulders) is politically toxic.
  • ORR Regulatory Investigation 2024: Office of Rail and Road intervention regarding the failure to deliver SVD performance targets. This external pressure forces NH to prioritize tech fixes over other operational improvements.
  • DNO Grid Capacity Constraints: The primary blocker for EV infrastructure. Remote MSAs (e.g., Tebay, Killington Lake) require multi-million pound transmission reinforcements from DNOs (ENWL, NGED) that exceed the commercial viability of the charging revenue alone.
  • Legacy Funding Model (Capex vs Opex): The Treasury rule that allows borrowing for 'New' digital schemes (RIS Capital) but restricts funding for maintaining the systems they create (Resource/Opex). This structural flaw creates 'zombie projects'—pilot mobility services that launch successfully but die because Operations cannot afford the cloud hosting or software licensing fees after handover.
  • RIS2 Capital Baseline: The rigid financial envelope (2020-2025) defined by DfT. Inflationary pressure on schemes like A66 Northern Trans-Pennine is forcing a trade-off: either de-scope the technology (reducing future operational capability) or delay the opening date (missing RIS commitments).
  • Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2) Budget Envelope: The rigid funding settlement (2020-2025). Inflation (construction materials) has rendered the original scope undeliverable. This forces the 'Tier 0' decision board to descale projects or push them to RIS3, creating 'zombie schemes' that exist on paper but have no delivery route.
  • DMRB Update Latency: The time lag between identifying a systemic issue (via DfS or Incident) and publishing an updated standard (e.g., GG 104). Can take 18-24 months, leaving a window of operational risk.
  • NH Board Risk Appetite Statement: Formal quantitative and qualitative boundaries for risk acceptance. Creates significant tension in the Major Projects Directorate where 'Zero Harm' safety appetite conflicts with the 'Construction Cost' appetite required to deliver schemes like the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine within the RIS envelope.
  • Legacy Operational Technology Debt: The burden of maintaining aging roadside technology (MIDAS radar, emergency roadside telephones) which consumes OPEX capability. This constraint actively inhibits the 'Response Development' to digital megatrends because the budget is consumed by maintaining end-of-life assets to satisfy ORR availability targets.
  • ORR Efficiency KPI Target: The regulatory requirement to deliver >£2bn efficiency savings in RIS2/3. This drives the architectural push for 'standardised designs' and 'digital twins', but often results in 'value engineering' that strips out future-proofing resilience (e.g., reducing drainage capacity to minimum CD 529 standards).
  • TSRGD 2016 Compliance: Statutory legal instrument dictating signal aspects. HART contains hard-coded logic to prevent illegal signal combinations (e.g., specific speeds alongside Red X). This logic makes HART rigid; implementing new signal types for Digital Roads initiatives requires deep-code intervention, slowing down innovation cycles.
  • DMRB GG 128 Requirements for reporting and recording incidents: The governing standard that dictates the data schema and process workflows configured within HART. It mandates the categorization of events (e.g., AIRS categories), the 20-day investigation timeline for severe incidents, and the specific requirements for reporting 'incursions' into traffic management. Non-compliance here creates direct legal exposure under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.
  • PAS 2080 Carbon Management Standard: Requires supply chain to evidence whole-life carbon reduction. Creates a massive trade-off tension: low-carbon concrete alternatives often require longer curing times, conflicting with 'Open for Traffic' P50 schedule commitments.
  • 5.9 GHz ITS Spectrum Reservation: Spectrum band (5.875-5.905 GHz) reserved for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS-G5 / C-V2X). A strategic architectural battleground: NH requires this for future Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) safety messaging (DMRB GG 104 safety cases), while the tech industry lobbies Ofcom to open this band for generic Wi-Fi expansion, threatening potential interference with safety-critical V2X pilots.
  • Ofcom Spectrum Licensing: Regulatory constraints managing interference and allocation. NH must pay for licenses for microwave links and adhere to power limits on the 5.8 GHz band to avoid interference with satellite services.
  • RIS2 Capital Enhancement Budget (Roads Period 2): The fixed funding envelope allocated by DfT for the 2020-2025 period, acting as a hard financial constraint on pavement renewal volumes and the Legacy Concrete Roads reconstruction programme.
  • Network Occupancy Management (NROC): Operational constraints managed by the Network Occupancy Management System (NOMS/NROC), limiting when pavement works can occur (e.g., Chapter 8 lane closures) to minimize delay minutes and journey time reliability impact.
  • DMRB GG 103 Sustainable Development and Design: Standards mandate requiring design life assessment, focusing on material efficiency, durability, and adaptability for future generations.
The governing standard mandating the inclusion of sustainable development in design decision-making.
Often conflicts with GG 104 (Safety Risk) when proposing reduced lighting or narrower cross-sections to save embodied carbon.

ARCHIMATE:CONTRACT (10 components):
---------------------------------
  • Area 10/12 Asset Delivery Maintenance Contracts: Term maintenance contracts for the North West and Yorkshire. These contracts are critical for maintaining LARS (Lane Availability Reporting System) data and delivering winter service duties. Friction exists here: while NH defines *what* needs doing (Maintenance Requirements), the contractor holds the plant and labour, creating bottlenecks during severe weather events.
  • Regional Delivery Partnership (RDP) Framework: The primary vehicle for delivering RIS2 schemes >£100m. Unlike previous transactional contracts, RDP attempts to incentivise outcomes, but struggles with the practical application of the Collaborative Performance Framework (CPF) when supply chain margins are squeezed. Governs delivery of schemes like the M6 Junction 19-21a upgrades.
The primary contractual vehicle for RIS2 major schemes.
It uses NEC4 ECC Option C (Target Cost with Activity Schedule).
It was designed to incentivize collaboration, but in reality, often devolves into arguments over Disallowed Cost and Pain/Gain share when scope creep occurs due to evolving DMRB standards (e.g., GG 104 safety risk requirements).
  • NRTS2 Telecommunications Service Agreement: The backbone contract (currently Telent) providing connectivity for 30,000+ roadside assets to the RCCs and NTOC. A major constraint is the rigidity of this PFI-style arrangement, which makes agile deployment of new sensor types (e.g., for Stopped Vehicle Detection validation) slow and legally complex.
  • Collaborative Delivery Framework (CDF): The heavy hitters. Tier 1 framework (Balfour Beatty, Costain, Skanska, etc.) for schemes >£100m. Designed for Early Contractor Involvement (ECI), but often treated as a transactional pricing mechanism by procurement, undermining the 'Collaborative' title.
  • NEC4 Engineering and Construction Contract (A428): The commercial battleground. Target Cost contract with Activity Schedule. Tension exists over 'Pain/Gain' share mechanisms as inflation pushes actual costs above the target, incentivizing the contractor to flood the Project Manager with Early Warning Notices (EWNs).
  • NEC4 Option C (Target Contract with Activity Schedule): The standard commercial vehicle for major schemes like A66 and A428. Theoretically shares pain/gain, but in reality, compensation events regarding ground conditions often shift the risk back to National Highways, eroding the 'efficiency' savings claimed in the RIS delivery plan.
The specific contractual mechanism governing the pain/gain share.
Includes Clauses for Compensation Events (CEs) and Early Warnings (EWNs).
This is where the friction lives: Commercial pushes for strict adherence to the defined cost, while Major Projects argues for scope changes to meet 'Open for Traffic' dates.
  • M25 DBFO Contract (Connect Plus): Legacy 30-year Design-Build-Finance-Operate PFI contract ending 2039. This is an architectural straightjacket; while it transfers risk, it locks National Highways into rigid payment mechanisms indexed to availability. It complicates the rollout of new digital standards (e.g., migrating M25 signals to HART) because contract variations are prohibitively expensive.
  • Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2): The £27.4bn statutory funding instrument (2020-2025). It legally commits us to enhancements like A303 Stonehenge and A428, creating a rigid capital envelope that leaves little flexibility when inflation spikes construction costs.
The £27.4bn statutory investment plan (2020-2025) mandating delivery of schemes like A303 Stonehenge and Lower Thames Crossing.
Funding is ring-fenced for Capital (Capex), creating a tension where new assets are built but Resource (Opex) for maintenance is constrained.
  • Regional Delivery Partnership (RDP): The primary delivery vehicle for RIS2 Regional Investment Programme (RIP) schemes (e.g., A428 Black Cat). Utilizes 'Delivery Integration Partners' (DIPs) like Skanska or Costain. Structurally creates a tension where DIPs are incentivised on 'outcomes' but constrained by legacy DMRB standards.
  • Scheme Delivery Framework (SDF): Replaced the Asset Support Delivery Framework (ASDF). Used primarily for Operations renewals (pavement, barriers, drainage). Divides England into super-regions, but creates interface friction with RDP schemes where geographic boundaries overlap (e.g., M6 operational maintenance vs. major upgrade works).

ARCHIMATE:COURSEOFACTION (17 components):
---------------------------------------
  • RIS3 (Road Investment Strategy 3) Pipeline Planning: The strategic investment plan for 2025-2030. Currently under immense pressure to pivot from 'new capacity' to 'renewals and maintenance' due to the crumbling concrete roads estate (e.g., A12, A14) and inflation eroding buying power.
  • CAV Infrastructure Readiness Strategy (RIS3): Strategic alignment of digital initiatives within Road Investment Strategy 3 (RIS3) to support SAE Level 3/4 automation. Focuses on the transition from physical-heavy infrastructure to digital-twin enabled operations, specifically targeting the A2/M2 and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine schemes. Addresses the tension between sinking capital into roadside hardware (RSUs) versus relying on cellular (C-V2X) coverage.
  • DfT Future of Transport Regulatory Review (Micromobility Sandbox): The specific regulatory sandbox mechanism (2020-2024) utilizing Vehicle Special Orders (VSOs) under the Road Traffic Act 1988 to bypass primary legislation restrictions. Operationally, this delegates authority to Local Transport Authorities (e.g., West Midlands, Tees Valley) to trial e-scooters and delivery bots. For National Highways, this creates a critical operational friction at the SRN interface (e.g., A-road crossings, grade-separated junctions like M6 J6), requiring us to assess how non-standard vehicle dynamics interact with standard DMRB CD 123 geometric designs.
  • Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2) Delivery Plan: The current 5-year strategic plan (£27.4bn). Heavily skewed towards capital enhancements (A303 Stonehenge, A428 Black Cat) at the expense of the renewal backlog, creating friction in asset lifecycle management.
  • Project Speed Efficiency Initiative (CIP Acceleration): Government-mandated initiative to cut NSIP delivery timelines by 33-50%. For National Highways, this specifically targeted the DCO pre-application phase for the Complex Infrastructure Programme (CIP). It forced a move from sequential to parallel design/consultation workflows but created significant friction with Statutory Environmental Bodies (SEBs) who lacked resource to match the tempo.
  • Digital Roads Strategy 2025: The 'Vision 2050' shift from concrete to data. Aims to implement Connected and Autonomous Plant (CAP) and Digital Twins, but is severely constrained by the technical debt in the HART and CHARM legacy stacks.
  • 60mph Speed Limit Enforcement (Air Quality): Operational intervention on M1, M6, and M602 to reduce NO2 emissions. This is a 'soft' infrastructure solution to a 'hard' chemical problem. It artificially suppresses the 'Average Speed' metric, negatively impacting the Road Period performance reporting to the ORR.
  • Digital Roads Strategy Implementation: Strategic shift from physical to digital infrastructure. Aims to implement V2X and digital twins. Often conflicts with the 'potholes first' political pressure and maintenance backlog funding.
The strategic response to technological acceleration.
Includes initiatives like the A2/M2 Connected Corridor.
However, implementation is often fragmented across regions, leading to interoperability issues between the National Traffic Operations Centre (NTOC) and regional control systems.
  • Digital Roads Upskilling Programme: Strategic initiative to pivot the workforce from 'operating the road' to 'managing the system'. Includes retrofitting data literacy into the Traffic Officer curriculum and establishing the Digital Academy. Critical for the transition from NTOC legacy systems to the new HART (Highways Agency Road Management System) architecture.
  • HART (Highways Agency Roadside Technology) Transformation Programme: The critical migration from legacy NRTS (National Roads Telecommunications Services) transmission contracts to a sovereign, IP-based fibre operational technology network. This is not just IT; it's the nervous system for roadside assets. Delays here actively block the 'Digital Roads' vision by trapping us in TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) legacy constraints. Essential for supporting future V2X and reducing dependency on proprietary telco operational envelopes.
  • Digital Roads Strategy (Connected Corridors): The strategic ambition for 2025-2030, focusing on V2X (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) readiness and GLOSA (Green Light Optimization Speed Advisory). Currently a 'paper tiger' until HART infrastructure is live on key corridors like the M25 and M6. It competes for R&D funding with immediate safety retrofits required by the Smart Motorway stocktake.
  • Asset Management Transformation (IAM IS & dDSS): Moving from cyclical renewal to predictive maintenance using the Integrated Asset Management Information System (IAM IS). The trade-off is the immense data cleansing burden required to make legacy 'as-built' drawings (often PDF or paper) compatible with BIM Level 3 standards and the decision support tools (dDSS) defined in ADMM.
  • Net Zero Highways Plan (Carbon Management): Strategic drive to decarbonise the SRN by 2050. Immediate operational impact is the 'Project Rapid' rollout of EV charging infrastructure at motorway service areas, which is currently constrained by DNO (Distribution Network Operator) grid capacity and the physical space constraints at legacy service sites.
  • Operation Brock / Stack: Contingency for cross-channel disruption (M20). A prime example of BCP becoming 'Business as Usual'. Requires massive resource diversion from other regions, degrading national resilience.
  • Operation Brock (M20): Contraflow system for cross-channel disruption. A massive operational trade-off: sacrifices local network availability (Kent resilience) to store international freight. Consumes massive Traffic Officer resources, stripping coverage from other parts of the Area 4 network.
  • Project Speed (DCO Acceleration): DfT-mandated initiative to slash delivery times for NSIPs (Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects). It attempts to compress the DCO (Development Consent Order) pre-application phase. Tensions arise where this speed conflicts with the rigorous statutory environmental consultation requirements for complex schemes like the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine.
  • Legacy Concrete Roads Reconstruction Programme: A specific £400m allocated programme to repair or replace life-expired concrete road surfaces (often 40+ years old) on the SRN (e.g., A11, A14) to improve noise and safety.

ARCHIMATE:DATAOBJECT (11 components):
-----------------------------------
  • Raw Surface Condition Data (HDF5/XML): Terabytes of raw profilometry and imagery data. Contains specific datasets for Texture Depth (MPD), Rut Depth, and Longitudinal Profile (Variance). Data quality often degrades at junctions and roundabouts, creating 'blind spots' in the automated analysis.
  • Floating Vehicle Data (FVD) Stream: Probe data purchased from aggregators (INRIX, TomTom, Google). Essential for coverage on non-sensorised A-roads (A303, A66). Architectural trade-off: High latency (2-3 mins) makes it unsuitable for real-time safety signalling (AID) under TSRGD, but vital for Journey Time Reliability metrics reported to ORR.
  • DSSAD (Data Storage System for Automated Driving) Telemetry: The 'black box' data required to determine liability. NH currently has no direct access to this. We rely on police seizure, slowing down 'Green Claims' (damage recovery) for barrier repairs, impacting the regional renewals budget.
  • As-Built BIM Data (COBie): The digital representation of the physical road. Often delivered months post-construction with missing attributes, making immediate maintenance planning in IAM IS impossible.
  • Traffic Telemetry Data: Real-time flow and speed data generated by MIDAS loops, radar, and Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) systems. Essential for Smart Motorway safety algorithms and setting variable speed limits.
  • Incident Log Record: Structured data detailing SRN incidents, including start time, severity (Fatal/Serious/Slight), response resources (Traffic Officers/Emergency Services), and clearance times. Used for measuring Network Availability and Safety Performance.
  • Road Space Booking: A confirmed reservation of specific SRN lanes or carriageways for works. Includes temporal constraints, traffic management type (e.g., contraflow), and impact assessments.
  • Geotechnical Asset Score: Condition grading for earthworks (e.g., Class 1A to 5). Derived from principal inspections and used to prioritize renewals funding to prevent slope failures.
  • Structure Inspection Certificate: Formal record of visual and testing inspections on bridges and gantries, compliant with CS 450. Contains defect descriptions and severity scores feeding into the BCI.
  • Pavement Condition Index: Aggregated metrics for rutting, texture depth, and ride quality (LARS/SCRIM) derived from machine surveys. Determines skid resistance compliance against CS 228.
  • Datex II Data Feed: Standardized XML traffic data schema used to export NTIS network status to third-party aggregators (Google, Waze, TomTom) and Local Highway Authorities.

ARCHIMATE:DELIVERABLE (1 components):
------------------------------------
  • Strategic Road Network Initial Report (SRNIR): The 'Ask'. Published May 2023. Sets out NH's view of the network needs. It explicitly highlights the tension between 'maintain' vs 'enhance'. It leans heavily on DMRB GG 104 safety risk assessments to justify renewals over new capacity.

ARCHIMATE:DRIVER (20 components):
-------------------------------
  • Smart Motorway Evidence Stocktake (2020/2022): The massive strategic pivot point. Following the TSC report and paused rollout of ALR (All Lane Running), Route Strategies had to be completely rewritten to remove planned Smart Motorway schemes. This left a massive gap in how to address congestion on the M1 and M6, leading to a scramble for 'Digital Roads' alternatives that are not yet proven.
The political fallout from All Lane Running (ALR) safety concerns.
This has paralyzed confidence in deploying new technology without 100% proven safety cases.
It creates a massive friction against deploying experimental CAV infrastructure (e.g., digitized TROs) on the live network.
  • Capital Efficiency (RIS Efficiency KPI): The strict Treasury and DfT requirement to deliver schemes within the committed RIS2/RIS3 funding envelope. Drives aggressive descoping of 'gold-plated' assets, often misidentifying essential resilience features as 'nice-to-haves'.
  • RIS2/RIS3 Innovation Designated Funds: Ring-fenced DfT funding (distinct from the main Block Grant). While it funds pilots like the A2/M2 Connected Corridor, the separation from core Maintenance & Renewal (M&R) budgets creates a 'Valley of Death' where successful trials fail to transition into Business As Usual due to lack of operational expenditure (OPEX) cover.
  • Net Zero 2050 Carbon Mandate: Statutory obligation to decarbonise. Fundamentally conflicts with the RIS2 goal of increasing capacity via road widening (e.g., A66 Northern Trans-Pennine).
  • Freight Capacity Demand: Projected 30% increase in freight traffic. Puts immense pressure on pavement assets (skid resistance) and drives the economic case for widening schemes like the Lower Thames Crossing.
  • Cabinet Office PPN 06/20 (Social Value): Mandatory government procurement policy requiring a minimum 10% weighting for social value in all central government contracts, fundamentally altering how we evaluate Tier 1 bids for schemes like A66 and LTC.
  • RIS2 (Road Investment Strategy 2) Commitments: The statutory investment plan (2020-2025). Operations are currently skewed by the need to 'burn' capital budget on schemes like A428 Black Cat before the period ends, often at the expense of revenue-funded maintenance which is severely squeezed.
  • Civil Engineering Competence Scarcity: Critical shortage of Senior Quantity Surveyors and Project Directors capable of managing complex DCO requirements. Creates a 'war for talent' between National Highways, HS2, and Nuclear sectors, impacting delivery confidence on the Lower Thames Crossing.
  • Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) Mandate: The requirement (Environment Act 2021) to deliver 10% net gain on schemes like A428 Black Cat and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine. Creates massive land-take operational overhead, forcing the acquisition of land solely for offsetting rather than SRN operations, complicating the asset database in HADDMS.
The Environment Act 2021 requirement for +10% gain.
It is fundamentally incompatible with the land-take requirements of traditional lane widening.
Forces us to buy off-site credits or purchase expensive adjacent land, skewing the BCR (Benefit-Cost Ratio).
  • IT/OT Convergence Friction: The cultural and technical war between Enterprise IT (Office 365, Cloud, Security First) and Operational Technology (Roadside, Legacy protocols, Availability First). IT wants to patch systems weekly; OT Operations refuses downtime. This deadlock prevents rapid rollout of digital twin capabilities.
  • Post-ALR Public Trust Deficit: The catastrophic drop in public confidence following the Smart Motorway (All Lane Running) rollout and subsequent 2023 cancellation of new schemes. This creates a severe drag on RIS3 Digital Roads ambitions. Public equates 'Digital/Automated' with 'unsafe removal of hard shoulders'. The operational friction here is palpable—we cannot deploy V2X pilots without overcoming the perception that technology is a cost-cutting measure rather than a safety enhancement.
  • Climate Acceleration & Extreme Weather: Megatrend impacting SRN resilience. Specifically, the increasing frequency of 1-in-100-year storm events overwhelming drainage standards defined in DMRB CG 501. This drives the urgent need for Geotechnical Asset Management (GAM) reform, particularly for slope stability on aging assets like the M62 and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine route.
  • SRN Climate Resilience Imperative (Extreme Weather): The forcing function requiring adaptation of the Strategic Road Network to 4°C global heating scenarios. specifically addressing sea-level rise affecting coastal assets (A55, A259), scour risk at estuary crossings (Severn, Humber), and heat-induced pavement failure on concrete legacy sections (A14, M25). Drives the requirement for retrofitting drainage capacity beyond historical 1-in-100 year return periods.
  • Urbanisation and Orbital Congestion: Shift from long-distance strategic travel to short-hop orbital commuting (M25, M60, M42). This degrades the 'Strategic' nature of the SRN, turning motorways into local distributors, accelerating pavement wear (rutting) and reducing the validity of P50 journey time reliability metrics which weren't designed for stop-start urban friction.
  • Connected & Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) Disruption: Technological acceleration forcing a shift from physical infrastructure (tarmac/steel) to digital infrastructure. Creates tension between maintaining legacy operational tech (HALOGEN signs, copper loops) and investing in V2X readiness. Heavily influences the 'Digital Roads' vision but is constrained by the reality of the National Traffic Information Service (NTIS) legacy architecture.
  • Ageing Road User Demographic (>70s): The fastest-growing SRN user segment. This creates a tangible tension between standard design assumptions (reaction times, visual acuity) and reality. We are seeing a spike in 'Silver Wrong Way' incidents at complex interchanges like M6 J19. It forces a re-evaluation of signage visibility and lighting standards, conflicting with energy-saving 'midnight switch-off' policies.
  • Road User Safety (Safe Systems Approach): The primary driver for pavement interventions, specifically focusing on reducing skid-related incidents and removing defects (potholes) that pose risks to motorcyclists and vehicles moving at national speed limits.
  • Zero Harm (Home Safe and Well): National Highways' strategic safety driver aiming to eliminate fatal and serious injuries on the network. This drives the requirement for rapid incident clearance to prevent secondary collisions in queuing traffic.
  • Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2): The Government's long-term strategy for funding and improving the Strategic Road Network from 2020 to 2025, setting the performance specification and investment plan.
  • Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake: Strategic driver resulting from the Transport Select Committee inquiry, mandating the pause of new ALR schemes and the retrofit of Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) technology.

ARCHIMATE:FLOWRELATIONSHIP (43 components):
-----------------------------------------
  • : Handover of the scene from Police primacy to NH control. This is the highest friction point in the timeline, often delayed by lack of agreement on 'scene released' status.
  • : Once the vehicle is recovered, the pavement must be remediated. If fuel spills exceed surface absorption limits, resurfacing (WorkPackage) may be triggered instead of simple cleaning.
  • : Final safety check before reopening. The trade-off here is often between 'perfect repair' and 'opening with restrictions' to alleviate queueing traffic (secondary incident risk).
  • : Flow of confirmed incident data from the operational control system (CHARM) to the national publication system (NTIS). Architecture Tension: Protocol translation and batching here causes the notorious 'ghost signal' effect where signs remain lit after the incident is cleared.
  • : Operational feedback loop. TOs provide ground truth which often contradicts system logs. Essential for verifying if the 'Smart Motorway' technology actually worked as designed (e.g., did MIDAS detect the queue?).

  • : The optimized portfolio is codified into the final Delivery Plan, setting the hard targets (KPIs) for 2025-2030.
  • : Progression from lab/track (TRL) to live SRN environment. Major friction point: getting 'Road Space Booking' on the live network for trials is difficult as Control Centres (RCCs) prioritize availability (P50 metric) over experimentation.

  • : Data flows (often manually or via flat-file export) from the specialist SVP tool into the central CPF system used for wider supplier performance reviews. This 'air gap' causes latency in reporting.
  • : Streaming of real-time traffic events (DATEX II) into the lake. This link is fragile; if the legacy NTIS API throttles, the analytics platform goes blind, impacting retrospective analysis of major incidents.
  • : Ingestion of roadworks data (Lane Rental) from the DfT central system to display planned disruptions on the NH map.
  • : Unidirectional data flow of tunnel status. Often delayed due to XML schema mismatches between the legacy SCADA and NTIS v3.

  • : Unidirectional data flow of tunnel status. Often delayed due to XML schema mismatches between the legacy SCADA and NTIS v3.
  • : The critical data bridge. If IAM IS has old lane configuration data, NTIS sends wrong info to the public. The update cycle here is dangerously slow compared to the pace of scheme delivery.
  • : The disconnect. Tender data sits in Bravo; Execution data sits in CEMAR. There is currently a manual, error-prone handover of data between these systems, meaning the 'As Sold' margin is often lost in translation to the 'As Built' financial reality.
  • : Operational incident data flows from the command system (HART) to the public information system (NTIS) to ensure that roadside reality (e.g., 'Lane 1 Closed') is accurately reflected on public feeds and apps like Waze/Google Maps.

ARCHIMATE:GAP (6 components):
----------------------------
  • ADMM Data Compliance Gap: Discrepancy between the Asset Data Management Manual (ADMM) requirements and the actual GIS data delivered by construction partners. This gap prevents predictive maintenance algorithms (P50/P90 analysis) from functioning correctly on new scheme sections, creating a 'digital blind spot' for Asset Delivery mandates.
  • Asset Data Handover Gap: The operational void where Major Projects finish a scheme (e.g., A14) but the asset data hasn't fully migrated to IAM IS, leaving Maintenance teams blind to warranty status and maintenance schedules.
  • Operational Technology Integration Gap: The significant functional gap between the modern 'Digital Twin' data expected by LTC and the actual capabilities of the legacy NTIS/RCC environment.
  • BIM-to-Field Operations Gap: The disconnect between the 3D models delivered by MPD and the tools available to Traffic Officers and maintenance crews. Field operatives use iPads with simple map layers; they cannot render the heavy Revit/Navisworks models. Consequently, the expensive 'Digital Twin' often sits on a server while crews rely on PDF as-builts.
  • Operational Technology (OT) Assurance Void: A identified architectural gap. While IT systems (Exchange, SAP) are audited heavily, the bespoke OT in tunnels (e.g., Hindhead Tunnel SCADA) has limited independent assurance, relying entirely on maintenance contractors' self-certification, which poses a hidden resilience risk.
  • Rural Coverage Deficit: The operational gap between the requirement for 100% SRN communications coverage and the reality of commercial LTE/Airwave dead zones in Cumbria (A66) and the South West.

ARCHIMATE:GOAL (21 components):
-----------------------------
  • RIS2 KPI: 95% Pavement in Good Condition: The primary regulatory target monitored by the ORR. This metric creates a perverse incentive to resurface distinct sections of road to 'chase the percentage', sometimes ignoring deeper structural issues that don't manifest on the surface immediately.
Strategic performance commitment mandated by the Department for Transport (DfT) in Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2).
Requires National Highways to maintain at least 95% of the Strategic Road Network (SRN) pavement without need for immediate structural maintenance.
Monitored by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR).
  • Net Zero Highways 2030 (Corporate) & 2040 (Construction): The strategic mandate from DfT's Transport Decarbonisation Plan. Split into Scope 1 & 2 (Corporate - 2030) and Scope 3 (Construction - 2040). Creates significant tension with RIS3 capital efficiency targets, as low-carbon alternatives (e.g., geopolymer concrete) often carry a 15-20% cost premium over standard CEM I concrete, threatening the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) of schemes like A66 and A428.
  • Sustainable Strategic Road Network Growth: The theoretical balance between economic connectivity and environmental impact. In reality, a battleground where DCO applications are delayed by carbon challenges.
  • Digital Roads Vision 2025: The strategic ambition to move to data-driven maintenance. Heavily copied from the 'Rijkswaterstaat 2030' vision. However, unlike the Dutch, NH is hampered by legacy physical assets and disjointed systems (HADDMS vs IAM-IS) that make the 'Digital Twin' concept largely theoretical currently.
The strategic ambition for a connected, automated network.
Includes V2X and Connected Corridor trials.
Currently largely aspirational; limited by the inability to get real-time latency below 500ms due to the legacy NTIS-HART stack and gaps in the fibre telecommunications network (NRTS).
  • Net Zero Highways 2030/2040/2050 Commitment: The tripartite statutory target structure: Net Zero for own operations (Scope 1 & 2) by 2030, maintenance and construction (Scope 3) by 2040, and road user emissions by 2050. Currently creating massive friction with RIS3 affordability as low-carbon solutions often carry a 'green premium' that conflicts with DfT Value for Money assessments.
  • RIS3 Enhanced Capacity Outcome: The strategic imperative to increase SRN throughput and reduce congestion cost (currently £2bn/year). Drivers for schemes like A303 Stonehenge and A46 Newark Bypass. Fundamentally at odds with environmental load restrictions.
  • Net Zero 2050 (Corporate): National Highways' existential commitment to decarbonise maintenance and construction (PAS 2080 certified). Currently failing to align with the capital delivery reality of the A66 and LTC schemes, creating an 'accountability gap' between Major Projects (RIP) and Safety, Engineering and Standards (SES).
  • Zero Harm (2040 Target): Strategic ambition to eliminate fatal and serious injuries on the SRN by 2040, currently under pressure due to statistical plateauing in RIS2 and public confidence issues regarding Smart Motorways (ALR).
  • NIS Regulations Compliance & Cyber Resilience: Strategic imperative driven by the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations 2018. The current NRTS estate has air-gapped security by obscurity, but the HART architecture must introduce 'Secure by Design' principles to protect the SRN from state-sponsored cyber threats, a key requirement from the DfT and NCSC given the Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) status of the network.
  • Vision Zero Compliance (2040): The strategic goal to eliminate killed and seriously injured (KSI) casualties. This drives the 'Safe Systems' approach mandated by DfT. However, there is a massive trade-off here: introducing mixed-mode traffic (CAV + Human) initially increases risk entropy, threatening short-term KSI metrics for long-term gain.
  • Target: Zero Harm (Workforce Safety): The strategic outcome defined in 'Home Safe and Well'. It conflicts with operational reality where Traffic Officers are required to work in live lanes under 'fast roads' guidance to meet the 1-hour lane reopening target demanded by DfT.
  • Compliance with GG 104 (Safety Risk Management): The overriding DMRB standard that dictates safety communication. Public Affairs cannot over-promise safety benefits of Smart Motorways without aligning with the GG 104 safety risk assessments. This creates friction when trying to simplify complex 'hazard log' data for public consumption in 'Go Left' campaigns.
  • Efficiency (RIS2/RIS3 KPI): The binding constraint from the DfT and ORR to deliver significant operational expenditure reductions. All corporate transformation programmes (ERP, Estates, Digital) are ultimately servants to this metric. If we don't prove the savings here, the Treasury tightens the tap for RIS3 enhancements.
  • Home Safe and Well (2040): Strategic goal to eliminate fatal and serious injuries. Creates immediate trade-offs with P50 Network Availability targets when safety interventions require prolonged carriageway closures.
  • RIS Outcome: Smooth Traffic Flow: Strategic aspiration to minimize delay. In reality, this is compromised by the conflicting 'Safety' outcome which necessitates longer carriageway closures for incident investigation under DMRB GG 104.
  • Network Availability (P50) Resilience: The objective to maintain traffic flow during extreme weather. The trade-off is often managing safety (closing lanes for flooding/wind) vs. availability targets. Failure to meet P50 targets results in penalties from the ORR.
  • RIS3 Strategic Workforce Readiness: The objective to secure the capability required to deliver the Road Investment Strategy 3 (2025-2030), specifically addressing the shift from pure civil engineering to digital asset management and connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) enablement, amidst a shrinking labour market.
  • Net Zero Highways 2050: Statutory target defined in 'Net Zero Highways' plan. Broken down: Corporate Net Zero by 2030, Maintenance/Construction by 2040, Road User Emissions by 2050. The existential threat to the current RIS3 funding model.
  • RIS3 Safety Outcome: Halving Death and Serious Injury: The overriding 2025-2030 target. In reality, this is struggling against budget cuts. We are having to trade off expensive physical infrastructure changes (more Emergency Refuge Areas) against cheaper behavioral campaigns, which is a friction point with the ORR.
  • RIS2 Pavement Condition KPI Target: The strategic performance commitment monitored by the ORR to maintain at least 96.2% of the SRN pavement asset in a condition that does not require further investigation, as defined in the Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2).
  • Target Zero: National Highways' strategic goal to achieve zero harm on the network, driving the requirement for rigorous incident investigation and worksite protection technologies.

ARCHIMATE:INFLUENCERELATIONSHIP (21 components):
----------------------------------------------
  • : The Pause on ALR forces a re-evaluation of ERA spacing standards (CD 123) for retrofit schemes, creating a conflict between ideal safety standards and the practical reality of existing bridge infrastructure.
  • : Strong conflicting tension. The Carbon Mandate requires traffic reduction, while the Growth goal implies capacity increase. This unresolved strategic tension is stalling DCOs.
  • : Pushing for physical expansion of the network, creating the 'Build' pressure that conflicts with the 'Decarbonise' pressure.

  • : Negative influence. The lack of trust forces a retreat to conservative operational models, slowing the adoption of automation technologies that are theoretically required to hit the 2040 zero-harm target.
  • : Regulatory Friction. Project Speed demands acceleration, but GG 104 requires rigorous safety evidence that cannot be rushed. This creates a bottleneck where 'speed' meets 'statutory duty'.
  • : The massive cost of maintaining end-of-life systems like the National Roads Telecommunications Services (NRTS) acts as a brake on implementing new Digital Roads capabilities, forcing trade-offs in the capital programme.
  • : Forces the A428 team to select materials (e.g., aggregate replacements) that may have higher costs or different engineering properties to meet Net Zero targets.
  • : The CS 228 standard restricts the planning process by mandating interventions where skid resistance drops below the Investigatory Level (IL) for the specific site category.
  • : Availability of road space (bookings) strictly constrains when renewal work packages can be deployed on the network.
  • : Carbon constraints influence material selection (e.g., warm mix asphalt) and logistics within the renewal planning process.
  • : The Target Zero goal positively influences the investigation capability by prioritizing resources towards learning from every safety incident.
  • : RIS2 strongly influences the Procurement capability by defining the investment levels, major scheme enhancements (e.g., A428, A66), and performance outcomes that must be secured through the supply chain.
  • : The Net Zero requirement exerts significant influence on option selection and design within the CIP Value Stream, necessitating carbon management plans.
  • : GG 103 requirements drive the need for and specifications of the performance modelling capability.
  • : The Stocktake heavily influenced updates to standards, including requirements for Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) and Emergency Refuge Area (ERA) spacing.

  • QEII Bridge (Dartford Crossing): Critical strategic node on M25. High wind vulnerability. Protocol: 50mph speed limit at 50mph gusts; Closure at 60mph gusts. Economic Trade-off: Closure costs UK economy approx £1m/hour, creating immense pressure on the Severe Weather Cell to delay closure despite safety protocols.
  • A66 Trans-Pennine Route: High-altitude strategic connector. Highest risk for snow blockage. Often the first to close, severing east-west freight. Requires specific 'snow blower' asset allocation distinct from standard gritters.
  • Regional Control Centre (RCC) Godstone: Controls the south-east quadrant of the M25 and connective radials. High-pressure environment dealing with the highest traffic density in Europe. Operators here frequently override automated HART suggestions based on local tacit knowledge, creating a feedback loop gap in our automated systems data.
A key operational node managing the M25 South East quadrant.
This location is a pilot site for HART integration, exposing real-world issues where the theoretical architecture meets the reality of aging control room hardware and operator overload during severe weather events.

ARCHIMATE:OUTCOME (5 components):
--------------------------------
  • CAV Benefit: Cooperative Hazard Warning (Incident Detection): V2V/V2I latency reduction. Vehicles broadcasting 'Emergency Electronic Brake Light' (EEBL) alerts bypass the 30-60 second lag of MIDAS loop detection.
  • Restoration of Public Confidence in Smart Motorways: The primary strategic outcome sought by the 'Driving on Motorways' behavior change campaigns. This is measured against tracking polls regarding driver anxiety on ALR (All Lane Running) sections. The architecture here is split: Engineering delivers the Retrofit of Emergency Areas (ERAs), while Comms delivers the 'education' on how to use them.
  • Incident Verified and Classified: Creation of a verified incident log within the Command and Control system (HALOGEN/CHARM), categorized by severity (Bronze/Silver/Gold) and impact type (RTC, Debris, Stationary Vehicle). Triggers GG 104 safety risk assessment protocols for response dispatch.
  • RIS3 Investment Plan Delivery: Successful execution of the Road Investment Strategy (Period 3) capital portfolio, mitigating inflation risks and DCO (Development Consent Order) delays impacting schemes like the Lower Thames Crossing and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine.
  • RIS2 Safety Performance Target (50% KSI Reduction): The specific Road Investment Strategy 2 regulatory commitment to reduce Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) casualties by 50% by 2025 compared to the 2005-2009 baseline.

ARCHIMATE:PRINCIPLE (6 components):
----------------------------------
  • DMRB GG 103 Sustainable Development: The specific Design Manual for Roads and Bridges standard mandating sustainability assessment. Unlike GG 104 (Safety Risk), which is non-negotiable, GG 103 is frequently value-engineered out during the 'Detailed Design' phase when inflation squeezes the budget. This creates a compliance gap between the 'Preliminary Design' shown to the public and the 'As-Built' reality.
The standard mandating that design and management of the SRN must support sustainable development.
It provides the technical engineering authority for enforcing environmental social value, elevating it from 'nice to have' to 'standard compliance'.
  • GG 128 Requirements for Reporting and Assurance: The specific DMRB standard translating CDM 2015 into National Highways' operational context. It forces the 'Client' role to be explicitly defined within the complex matrix of Major Projects and Operations directorates, often creating tension over who holds the budget for safety-critical design changes.
  • DMRB LD 118 Biodiversity Design: Design Manual for Roads and Bridges standard governing how biodiversity is integrated into highway design. Defines the mitigation hierarchy (Avoid, Mitigate, Compensate). Often in tension with DMRB CD 127 (Cross-sections) where engineering safety widths compete with habitat creation space.
  • DMRB GG 104 Requirements for Safety Risk Assessment: The standard defining the As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) framework. Often interpreted for structural safety, but technically applies to occupational health risks, creating friction when mitigation costs soar.
The overarching safety standard.
Mandates that any change to the highway system (including digital interventions) must demonstrate ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) risk profiles.
Often a bottleneck for agile software deployment in operational technology.
The governing safety standard.
Any introduction of L4/5 infrastructure must prove 'So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable' (SFAIRP) safety levels.
This is the primary blocker for ALR (All Lane Running) automation, as the 'Stopped Vehicle Detection' (SVD) systems (Radar) have false positive rates that complicate automated fallback strategies.
The 'Safety Risk Assessment' standard.
Often weaponized during handover: Ops rejects handover citing GG 104 non-compliance on residual risks; MP argues risks are 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) to meet opening dates.
The 'Bible' for safety governance.
Every deviation from standard, including the Smart Motorway safety cases, relies on a GG 104 assessment.
The tension lies in the interpretation of 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) when budgets are cut.
The 'Bible' of safety governance.
Requires As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) demonstration.
This standard is the primary constraint blocking the 'easy' rollout of digital innovations; every change to the SRN must pass a GG 104 assessment, which is time-consuming and rigorous.
It is the friction point between Safety, Engineering & Standards (SES) and Major Projects.
Every deviation from standard design (CD 123) requires a GG 104 assessment, which creates massive bottlenecks in the technical assurance process for schemes like the A303 Stonehenge.
  • Operational Design Domain (ODD) Compliance: The specific conditions under which an AV can operate. NH must guarantee infrastructure (pavement quality, signage) meets the ODD. Failure suggests NH could be liable for 'contributory negligence' if our BCI (Bridge Condition Index) or skid resistance data is inaccurate.
  • DMRB CG 501 Design of Highway Earthworks: Standard defining geotechnical design requirements. Operational tension exists where legacy earthworks (pre-standards) cannot economically meet CG 501 requirements without total reconstruction, leading to a 'manage and monitor' approach via specific maintenance requirements rather than structural resolution.

ARCHIMATE:PRODUCT (1 components):
--------------------------------
  • Personal Light Electric Vehicles (PLEVs) & Delivery Bots: The innovation class including rented e-scooters and autonomous delivery pods (Starship Technologies). Operationally, these introduce a new hazard profile: small visual footprint, rapid acceleration, and low stability. They fall outside the design parameters of legacy barrier systems (DMRB CD 377) and create specific blind-spot risks for HGV traffic on the SRN, particularly at logistics hubs near motorway junctions.

ARCHIMATE:REQUIREMENT (14 components):
------------------------------------
  • GG 104 Safety Risk Assessment: The DMRB standard for Safety Risk. Operations must demonstrate that deferring a renewal scheme (due to budget) does not increase safety risk to 'intolerable' levels. This is the primary lever used to force emergency funding release.
DMRB Standard GG 104.
Any V2X system used for control (e.g., Virtual Gantries/Variable Speed Limits) must meet safety integrity levels.
C-V2X software complexity makes proving this harder than the simpler ITS-G5 stack.
The overarching safety governance standard.
It demands that risks be reduced 'So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP).
Operational friction arises when retrofitting legacy assets (e.g., narrow lanes on the M6 Thelwall Viaduct) where full standard compliance is physically impossible without demolition.
  • Requirement: Implied element created to satisfy AI-discovered relationship
  • GG 104 Safety Risk Assessment (ALARP): The over-arching safety standard. If a Principal Inspection is deferred due to budget, a GG 104 assessment must prove the risk remains 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable'. This is the bureaucratic shield used by Directors when funding is tight.
  • BIM Level 3 / Information Management Mandate: The requirement for full lifecycle asset data integration. In theory, it enables predictive maintenance. In practice, legacy asset data (in systems like IAM IS) is fragmented, making it difficult to map new A428 or A66 digital assets into the brownfield maintenance regime.
  • GG 104 Safety Risk Assessment Competency: Mandatory requirement for engineers to apply GG 104 'Requirements for safety risk assessment' to AI/ML algorithms used in traffic management. Current engineering workforce lacks the mathematical grounding to apply safety arguments to non-deterministic algorithms, delaying the approval of autonomous plant machinery on the A14 legacy handover and A428 schemes.
  • Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) Performance Target: Specific detection rate requirement (e.g., 80% detection in <20s) for radar systems on Smart Motorways. Failure to meet this requirement constitutes a major operational risk, forcing the deployment of expensive mitigation (CCTV operators at NTOC).
  • RIS2 Performance Specification (KPIs): The outcome contract with government. Includes strict metrics like 'P50 Network Availability' and 'LARS' (Lane Availability Reporting System). Major Projects often negatively impact LARS during construction (roadworks), creating tension between the Capital Delivery (building it) and Operations (running it) directorates regarding road space booking.
  • PAS 2080:2023 Certification: Global standard for managing carbon in infrastructure. National Highways is certified, but cascading this requirement to Tier 1 and Tier 2 supply chain (Balfour Beatty, Costain, etc.) is the operational bottleneck.
  • Net Zero Highways (Construction & Maintenance) 2040: The corporate requirement to decarbonize maintenance activities, mandating the use of warm mix asphalts, in-situ recycling, and low-carbon materials in pavement renewals.
  • Maximize Lane Availability (KPI): The RIS2/RIS3 performance metric requirement to ensure the SRN is open to traffic. Incident clearance must be efficient to minimize 'Lane Impact' duration, impacting the KPI for Network Availability.
  • Net Zero Carbon 2050: Strategic requirement compelling CIP schemes to minimize embodied carbon in construction (PAS 2080) and support low-carbon network operations.
  • RIS2 KPI: Network Availability: Performance metric requiring >98% of the SRN to be available to traffic, penalizing unauthorized or overrunning roadworks.
  • Home Safe and Well Strategy: National Highways' health, safety, and wellbeing strategy aiming to eliminate fatal and serious risks on the SRN by 2040.
  • KSI Reduction Target (50% by 2025): Performance metric mandated by the DfT and ORR to reduce Killed or Seriously Injured numbers by 50% against the 2005-2009 baseline, driving safety interventions.

ARCHIMATE:RESOURCE (3 components):
---------------------------------
  • Electric Traffic Officer Fleet (PHEV/BEV): Transition of the Land Rover Discovery and Volvo operational fleet to PHEV/BEV. Operational tension: Range anxiety during major incidents (e.g., 6+ hour closures on M6) and lack of rapid charging at outstation depots like Heston or Perry Barr.
  • University Partnership (UWE/Coventry): Talent pipeline mechanism intended to funnel graduates with ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) degrees directly into Safety, Engineering and Standards (SES) directorate. Success is currently limited by the location of NH offices (Birmingham/Guildford) vs tech hubs.
  • Operational Technology (OT) Engineering Workforce: Specialised engineers required to bridge the gap between legacy roadside equipment (MIDAS, signals) and modern IP-based networks. Critical for maintaining the National Traffic Operations Centre (NTOC) and implementing the Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake recommendations.

  • Transport Focus: Represents the road user. They input into Route Strategies via the Strategic Roads User Survey (SRUS). Their data often highlights 'potholes' and 'roadworks management' as top priorities, which conflicts with the internal engineering focus on major capacity enhancements. They force the inclusion of 'User Satisfaction' metrics into the RIS performance specification.
User watchdog representing the driver's voice.
Heavily critical of roadworks communication accuracy and the 'feel' of safety on Smart Motorways, driving the shift in KPI metrics towards 'User Confidence' rather than just 'Statistical Safety'.
  • Office of Rail and Road (ORR): The independent monitor that holds NH's feet to the fire regarding efficiency (KPIs). They scrutinize the Route Strategy evidence base to ensure proposed schemes actually deliver value (BCR). They specifically challenge the 'Efficiency' KPI within the Route Strategies, questioning if the stated benefits of schemes like the Lower Thames Crossing justify the capital expenditure.
The regulator.
They don't care about our 'Digital Vision' if it compromises safety.
Following the Transport Committee report, they are aggressively auditing our technology performance (SVD availability, MIDAS reliability).
They hold the licence to fine us if we miss RIS2 KPI targets like Network Availability.
The independent regulator monitoring National Highways' performance against RIS2 KPI targets.
They specifically scrutinize the 'User Satisfaction' KPI (target 82%) and 'Network Availability' (P50).
Communications teams manage the narrative around the Annual Assessment of Safety and Performance, often trying to contextualize 'Red' or 'Amber' performance indicators.
The Highways Monitor.
They are currently scrutinizing NH's failure to meet KPI targets (specifically KP1 on safety and Availability).
Their 'Annual Assessment' drives the urgency of internal audit activities.
The independent regulator holding NH's feet to the fire on KPI compliance.
They specifically intervene on 'Regionally Significant' safety metrics and forced the 2022 Smart Motorways Evidence Stocktake.
Their annual assessment drives the frantic end-of-year maintenance rushes to meet availability targets.
Statutory monitor enforcing the RIS Performance Specification.
They focus heavily on 'Efficiency' and 'Safety' metrics, often creating tension with NH Operations who prioritize real-time network flow over retrospective efficiency reporting.
  • Host Local Authorities (Planning & Highways): County and Unitary councils (e.g., Kent County Council, Thurrock Council) who hold statutory power to comment on the adequacy of consultation. Relationship is often adversarial due to tensions between national strategic needs (SRN capacity) and local network impacts (rat-running, air quality).
  • SRN Road User: The end-user of the Strategic Road Network. Currently characterized by high anxiety regarding automation (ADAS) and 'Smart' infrastructure. Their behavior is the primary uncontrolled variable in our safety models (GG 104). Trust is currently measured via the SRN User Survey, where perception of safety often lags behind statistical safety (STATS19 data).
  • Logistics UK & Major Freight Hauliers: Key users demanding predictable journey times over pure speed. They are pushing for the 'Infrastructure as a Service' model where they pay premiums for guaranteed slots or platooning privileges on the M6 and M1. Their requirements clash with the 'open access' principle of the public highway.
  • Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) & Disabled Motorists: Includes the 2.4m Blue Badge holders. Critical focus following the Smart Motorways Stocktake. The fear of breaking down in a Live Lane (ALR) without a hard shoulder is significantly higher in this demographic, driving political pressure from the Transport Select Committee.
  • SRN Road User (Freight & Personal): The ultimate consumer of the network. Experience is currently fragmented between digital journey planning (Google/Waze), physical infrastructure reality (potholes/roadworks), and incident response. Highly sensitive to journey time reliability (P50) and information latency.

The necessary traffic management (lane closures) to build the scheme directly reduces the P50 score for the region. This creates a perverse incentive where Ops tries to block Capital Delivery to save their monthly stats.

Currently, this link is slow; risks often materialize (e.g., bitumen price spikes) before the formal horizon scanning process logs them.
  • UsedByRelationship d316bd30-13b8-41d2-bc58-a006454fcb94->5fa6943a-dd3c-455d-bfc4-b6b5728ec081: The sanitized version of the register serves the ORR's monitoring function. There is a constant tension here: NH wants to show risk is 'managed', while ORR looks for evidence that risks are being 'masked' to protect the RIS delivery status.
  • UsedByRelationship 3c9ab009-4337-4008-ac0f-a982bffe6356->3c6afe6a-c54b-4592-8442-827d102a2045: The design of a control (e.g., 'Set VMS to 40mph during congestion') triggers the role of the NTOC Operator. If the control design is poor (e.g., too many false alerts from MIDAS), the Operator becomes desensitized, increasing the risk of missing a genuine incident.

This incentivizes 'thin surfacing' treatments to improve the numbers quickly, rather than long-term structural renewals which are needed but don't improve the immediate P50 score as efficiently.
  • UsedByRelationship 7c1a552c-746c-462e-9f1d-1a880855243d->59b09c1c-d69e-48c9-b37c-796ef06f215b: Deteriorating BCI scores (e.g., on the M5/M6 viaducts) drive emergency funding requests that disrupt the planned RIS3 capital allocations. This is the tension between 'Planned Preventative Maintenance' and 'Reactive Safety Works'.
  • UsedByRelationship 0a51406c-c4bb-48c5-aa37-65c0f360fc26->0849aaf9-6963-4eda-aeb4-49271fc81946: The ORR scrutinises the 'Efficiency KPI', creating pressure on Operations to reduce maintenance unit costs, which architecturally manifests as deferred renewal of non-critical assets (e.g., drainage off-network).

However, this relies on the Target Price being agreed. In the A428 case, material price volatility forced a renegotiation of risk allocation before this trigger could be pulled, delaying the 'spade in the ground'.

Specifically, the 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP) principle forces the project to demonstrate that additional fire safety systems (beyond standard) were considered. This drives up the capital cost significantly to satisfy the Safety Control Review Group.

  • UsedByRelationship DMRB GG 104 - Requirements for Safety Risk Assessment->f06433f3-45d2-46c9-b7e5-4e92725d7368: Acts as a brake on deployment. Every incremental step in autonomous freight (e.g., reducing following distance in platoons) requires a massive GG 104 safety argument that NH is currently risk-averse to sign off.
  • UsedByRelationship 60277643-992a-4808-ad4f-057b06ca507d->460bcf80-a727-4503-9dde-147238f7ab74: Provides the HD Map base layer. The relationship is fragile because HART is designed for asset accounting, not millisecond-precision navigation.

  • UsedByRelationship 441b1d26-91c6-4327-9808-998e300f8de2->f67066be-e862-4c52-a0e5-d0a56b77c476: The shift in demographics is changing the operational reality of Traffic Officers from 'clear the road' to 'welfare management'. Older drivers are more likely to suffer medical episodes or confusion, increasing the duration of incidents (Code 10s) and reducing lane availability.
  • UsedByRelationship 2b242f94-1d44-49ee-b9f5-066e8b427a3b->8feba8c3-4b29-4731-bde9-e978c0a8203c: GG 104 provides the rigorous evidence framework required to prove that our designs (like the A66 or Smart Motorway retrofits) will actually contribute to the safety target. Without a signed GG 104 safety plan, no scheme goes to construction.
  • UsedByRelationship eb32d7ed-4550-4034-8be5-aa291149052a->06c7e27a-5bb5-4593-bbd3-307b93620559: HART is the primary tool used by NTOC to log incidents, dispatch Traffic Officers, and set signals. It is a critical dependency; if HART fails (which happens with legacy patches), NTOC goes blind and reverts to voice radio.
  • UsedByRelationship a27579a5-2e78-4208-b91f-ac995c5d788b->47dcf23c-dd72-497a-b1cf-d0f0ca9d2757: NTIS processes the raw data to populate the 'Check for Delays' service. There is a lag here; NTIS updates often trail reality by 5-10 minutes, which causes frustration for urban commuters who expect real-time Google-level accuracy.
  • UsedByRelationship e2c5359e-dbe7-47c1-a51b-11ba6122c3ad->49ab72cf-26ce-4421-815a-38670efd2288: The noise from old concrete roads is the #1 complaint in the 'Noise' component of NRUSS, particularly from residents in expanding urban areas near the A14. Fixing this boosts the score but drains the renewals budget.

Operational reality: The high false alarm rate causes operators to second-guess the system, delaying the setting of 'Red X' signals which are critical for preventing collisions with stranded vehicles.
  • UsedByRelationship eb32d7ed-4550-4034-8be5-aa291149052a->80c9eb53-9fce-4444-b55c-72b1aa7d8677: Provides the signal setting capability. The friction is that HART is a command-line era tool being used to manage a digital-age network. Operators must translate mental models of dynamic traffic into legacy codes, slowing response times during complex multi-incident scenarios.

Operational Tension: IAM is built on legacy schemas. LTC is delivering rich BIM/Digital Twin data. There is a massive 'gap' where the rich data must be dumbed down to fit into the legacy operational database, destroying much of the value created during construction.
  • UsedByRelationship 26055253-ff37-49cd-8a7a-70e9c141b487->a27579a5-2e78-4208-b91f-ac995c5d788b: Activation of Brock requires complex reconfiguration of the digital map in NTIS to reflect that the motorway is now a car park. If this sync fails, SatNavs route traffic into the jam.

Aspirationally a BIM Level 3 project.
LTC is attempting to create a cloud-native 'born digital' asset lifecycle.
Unlike standard schemes, LTC is bypassing some traditional ADMM constraints to test a true Digital Twin, creating a bifurcation in our architecture: standard RIS schemes vs.
the LTC 'spaceship' approach.
  • A303 Stonehenge Amesbury to Berwick Down: Dualling scheme including 3.3km tunnel. Critical for South West connectivity but stalled by Judicial Reviews regarding UNESCO World Heritage Site impact. Technical complexity: Tunnel boring through chalk aquifers requiring specialized ventilation control systems.
  • A1 Safety Package (Sandy to Black Cat) Remedial Works: Specific localized safety intervention targeting gap closures and junction improvements on the A1. Represents a 'designated fund' trade-off, where smaller interim safety fixes are deployed because the full A1 dualling scheme remains capital-constrained or deferred.

Direct response to the 2020 Evidence Stocktake and Transport Select Committee recommendations.
Installing 150+ additional Emergency Areas (ERAs) on ALR (All Lane Running) sections (e.g., M1, M6).
Consumes significant capital budget originally allocated for RIS2 enhancements, demonstrating the trade-off between safety remediation and new capacity.
  • Lower Thames Crossing (LTC) Development: The largest DCO application in UK history. It is effectively a separate enterprise within the enterprise. The architectural disconnect is that LTC is designing 'Digital Twin' operations that current NH legacy systems (NTIS) cannot actually support yet.
Currently consumes vast amounts of architectural resource for digital twin modeling and carbon baselining.
Its sheer scale creates a 'gravitational pull' that deprioritises smaller regional safety schemes.
The strategic anomaly.

The urgent operational response to the Government Stocktake; retrofitting 150+ additional Emergency Refuge Areas (ERAs) to existing ALR (All Lane Running) schemes; significantly disrupting traffic flow and consuming the renewals budget.
Retrofit scheme involving Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) radar installation.
Historical issue: Legacy ALR schemes often failed to record exact GPS locations of roadside tech assets in HART, causing 'ghost assets' in the control room and delaying maintenance response times.
  • Lower Thames Crossing (LTC) Carbon Pathfinder: Designated 'Pathfinder' project for low-carbon construction. Testing the limits of hydrogen plant on site and legally binding carbon limits in the DCO (Development Consent Order). If we miss the carbon targets here, the precedent for future NSIPs is catastrophic.
  • National Operational Technology Upgrade (RIS3 Preparation): The capital programme to retire the aging roadside copper network and move to cellular/fiber backhaul. Dependent on the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine digital twin pilot. This is the only way to reduce the OPEX bleed from legacy MIDAS maintenance.
  • HART (Highways Asset Resilience and Telemetry) Transformation Programme: The RIS2/RIS3 capital delivery vehicle replacing the legacy NRTS (National Roads Telemetry Services) contract held by Telent. This is not just 'new cables'; it is the migration of 30,000+ roadside assets from deterministic TDM/SDH legacy transmission to a fully IP-based, software-defined OT network. It is currently facing significant friction due to the PSTN switch-off deadline and the complexity of retrofitting IP convertors into decaying 600-series roadside cabinets on routes like the M25 and M6.
  • Lower Thames Crossing Digital Delivery: A £9bn scheme designated as a 'Pathfinder' for digital construction. Includes embedded ducting for fibre and provisions for future V2X, unlike legacy schemes. It serves as the architectural template for future RIS3 enhancements.
The flagship 'Digital Native' scheme.
Unlike the legacy M25, LTC is designed with a converged OT/IT network backbone.
It serves as the sandbox for 'passive operations'—where the tunnel control system manages incidents with minimal human intervention from the RCC.
  • A282 Dartford Tunnel Critical Safety Systems Upgrade: RIS3 pipeline scheme. Includes replacement of 1980s-era fire mains, LED lighting retrofit to reduce opex, and tunnel lining repairs. Operational nightmare: Requires overnight bore closures, impacting freight logistics and P50 Network Availability targets. Tensions with local stakeholders regarding noise and diversion routes.
  • National Emergency Area Retrofit Programme: The £900m operational response to the Trust Deficit. While not 'digital' per se, this physical intervention (adding 150+ emergency areas) is the prerequisite penance NH must pay to regain the social license to operate advanced digital schemes. It drains capital that would otherwise go to RIS3 digital innovations.
  • Future Finance & Business Services (FFBS) Programme: The strategic replacement of the legacy Oracle E-Business Suite with a cloud-native ERP (Oracle Fusion). This is not just an IT swap; it's a fundamental shift in how we report RIS2 efficiency to the ORR. The critical tension here is aligning standard SaaS financial workflows with the bespoke Project Control Framework (PCF) governance required for major schemes like the Lower Thames Crossing and A66 Northern Trans-Pennine. If this fails, our capitalisation logic for RIS3 funding becomes opaque.
  • Modern Workplace Programme (MWP): Migration to Microsoft 365, Teams, and SharePoint Online. While seemingly standard, the architectural headache is the integration with the Operational Technology (OT) network. We have to strictly segregate corporate O365 traffic from the National Traffic Operations Centre (NTOC) critical command systems (HART/NTIS) to prevent vectoring cyber threats into the strategic road network control layer, per NIS Directive requirements.
  • Strategic Workforce Planning (People Strategy): Focuses on the Total Resource Management (TRM) system replacement and Diversity & Inclusion targets. The critical operational gap is the shortage of Control Room Operators capable of managing Smart Motorway signals (ALR). The strategy is currently disconnected from the actual training pipeline for the 'Command and Control' competency framework.
  • Estates Transformation & Consolidation: Strategy to exit expensive commercial leases and consolidate into owned operational hubs (e.g., The Cube in Birmingham, Bridge House in Guildford). The operational tension is that while centralising Finance/HR saves money, closing smaller maintenance depots increases 'stem mileage' for Traffic Officer Units, potentially negatively impacting the 1-hour incident clearance KPI mandated by the DfT.
  • Smart Motorway Safety Evidence Stocktake Delivery: The massive retrofit programme (150+ new Emergency Areas). It directly degrades the 'Availability' KPI due to roadworks, creating a perverse incentive where investing in safety makes the region look like it is failing performance targets.
  • Lower Thames Crossing (LTC) DCO & Delivery: The largest single roads investment project since the M25. It consumes massive architectural and planning bandwidth. The DCO application volume alone creates a 'gravity well' that pulls experienced resources away from smaller regional renewal schemes. It is the primary driver for adopting new low-carbon construction standards.
  • Rapid Charging Fund (RCF) Delivery: RIS3 £950m intervention to upgrade Motorway Service Areas (MSAs) to high-powered (150kW+) chargers. Critical tension: 60% of MSAs lack DNO grid capacity. Requires complex commercial agreements with Gridserve, Moto, Welcome Break, and DNOs.
  • HART (Highways Agency Road Traffic) Programme: The critical but delayed initiative to replace the legacy traffic management stack. Slippage here forces the continued life-support of obsolescent control room systems, creating a 'technical debt cliff' for RIS3.
  • Smart Motorway Alliance (SMA) Safety Retrofit Programme: The operational reality following the government's pause on new ALR schemes. Resources originally ringfenced for new capacity are now consumed by retrofitting SVD (Stopped Vehicle Detection) radar and constructing additional Emergency Areas (ERAs) on the M1, M6, and M25 to meet ORR requirements. This creates significant resource contention for other RIS2 delivery schemes.
A set of schemes currently in 'Recovery' or 'Paused' status following the Government's 2023 cancellation of new ALR smart motorways.
The assurance focus has shifted from delivery (Stage 3/4) to safe stopped vehicle detection (SVD) retrofit and emergency area (ERA) retrofitting under the Evidence Stocktake.
The operational response to the Transport Committee and Stocktake.
Involves retrofitting Stopped Vehicle Detection (SVD) radar across All Lane Running (ALR) sections (e.g., M1, M6) to meet the 10-minute response commitment.
  • Emergency Area (ERA) Retrofit Programme: Direct response to the Transport Select Committee and ORR intervention. Physically cutting into the network to add refuge areas to existing ALR schemes (M1, M6). This is 'surgery while the patient is awake' - improving long-term safety but causing massive short-term congestion.
  • Lower Thames Crossing (LTC) DCO Process: The largest planning application in UK history. Currently in Development Consent Order (DCO) purgatory. It represents a massive capital overhang on the RIS3 budget. If approved, it fundamentally changes the traffic model for the M25 Dartford Crossing, requiring a total recalibration of the Dart Charge systems.
The largest single roads investment since M25.
Currently mired in extended Planning Inspectorate examination.
Represents a massive 'sunk cost' risk if DCO is refused; architecturally acts as a resource black hole for the Major Projects directorate.
Largest road project since the M25.
Currently stuck in Development Consent Order (DCO) purgatory.
The digital twin component is pioneering but disconnected from current Asset Management operational reality.
The largest DCO application in UK history.

The largest DCO application in history.
Consumes massive architectural resource for 'theoretical' future operations.
Design is constrained heavily by carbon limits and the need to prove value against the cancelled Smart Motorway programme.
A zombie project until final DfT sign-off.
  • National Emergency Area Retrofit (NEAR): The reactive programme to install 150+ new Emergency Areas (ERAs) on ALR schemes. This is a direct response to public confidence loss. It requires Taking Land (CPO) in some areas and major traffic management, ironically reducing network availability (LARS) to improve safety perception.
  • CHARM (Common Highways Agency Rijkswaterstaat Model) Delivery: The prolonged, complex initiative to replace HART with a modern, cloud-enabled C&C platform (based on DYNAC). The transition has been fraught with integration challenges, resulting in a hybrid architecture where HART remains the primary operational tool in many regions longer than planned. This parallel running creates distinct risks in data coherency and operator training fatigue.
  • Safety Information Management System (SIMS) Modernisation: The strategic initiative to replace the legacy HART instance. The goal is to move from a reactive 'system of record' to a predictive 'system of insight' using AI to analyse unstructured investigation text and enable API federation with supply chain systems to remove the double-keying friction.
